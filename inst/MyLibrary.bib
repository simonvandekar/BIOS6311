	abstract = {​This book is for students and researchers who have had a first year graduate level mathematical statistics course. It covers classical likelihood, Bayesian, and permutation inference; an introduction to basic asymptotic distribution theory; and modern topics like M-estimation, the jackknife, and the bootstrap. R code is woven throughout the text, and there are a large number of examples and problems.An important goal has been to make the topics accessible to a wide audience, with little overt reliance on measure theory. A typical semester course consists of Chapters 1-6 (likelihood-based estimation and testing, Bayesian inference, basic asymptotic results) plus selections from M-estimation and related testing and resampling methodology.Dennis Boos and Len Stefanski are professors in the Department of Statistics at North Carolina State. Their research has been eclectic, often with a robustness angle, although Stefanski is also known for research concentrated on measurement error, including a co-authored book on non-linear measurement error models. In recent years the authors have jointly worked on variable selection methods. ​},

	abstract = {Methodological research rarely generates a broad interest, yet our work on the validity of cluster inference methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) created intense discussion on both the minutia of our approach and its implications for the discipline. In the present work, we take on various critiques of our work and further explore the limitations of our original work. We address issues about the particular event-related designs we used, considering multiple event types and randomisation of events between subjects. We consider the lack of validity found with one-sample permutation (sign flipping) tests, investigating a number of approaches to improve the false positive control of this widely used procedure. We found that the combination of a two-sided test and cleaning the data using ICA FIX resulted in nominal false positive rates for all datasets, meaning that data cleaning is not only important for resting state fMRI, but also for task fMRI. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work on the fMRI literature as a whole, estimating that at least 10\% of the fMRI studies have used the most problematic cluster inference method (P = 0.01 cluster defining threshold), and how individual studies can be interpreted in light of our findings. These additional results underscore our original conclusions, on the importance of data sharing and thorough evaluation of statistical methods on realistic null data.},

	abstract = {In an editorial (this issue), I argued that Eklund, Nichols, and Knutsson’s ‘null data’ reflected resting-state/default network activity that inflated their false-positive rates. Commentaries on that paper were received by Nichols, Eklund, and Knutsson (this issue), Hopfinger (this issue), and Cunningham and Koscik (this issue). In this author response, I consider these commentaries. Many issues stemming from Nichols et al. are identified including: (1) Nichols et al. did not provide convincing arguments that resting-state fMRI data reflect null data. (2) Eklund et al. presented one-sample t-test results in the main body of their paper showing that their permutation method was acceptable, while their supplementary results showed that this method produced false-positive rates that were similar to other methods. (3) Eklund et al. used the same event protocol for all the participants, which artifactually inflated the one-sample t-test false-positive rates. (4) At p {\textless} .001, using two-sample t-tests (which corrected for the flawed analysis), all the methods employed to correct for multiple comparisons had acceptable false-positive rates. (5) Eklund et al. contrasted resting-state periods, which produced many significant clusters of activity, while null data should arguably be associated with few, if any, significant activations. Eklund et al.’s entire set of results show that commonly employed methods to correct for multiple comparisons have acceptable false-positive rates. Following Hopfinger along with Cunningham and Koscik, it is also highlighted that rather than focusing on only type I error, type I error and type II error should be balanced in fMRI analysis.},

	abstract = {Background
There is considerable evidence that the thalamus is abnormal in psychotic disorders. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed an intriguing pattern of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis characterized by reduced prefrontal cortex (PFC) connectivity and increased somatomotor-thalamic connectivity. However, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the onset, anatomical specificity, and clinical correlates of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis.
Methods
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected on 105 healthy subjects and 148 individuals with psychosis, including 53 early-stage psychosis patients. Using all 253 subjects, the thalamus was parceled into functional regions of interest (ROIs) on the basis of connectivity with six a priori defined cortical ROIs covering most of the cortical mantle. Functional connectivity between each cortical ROI and its corresponding thalamic ROI was quantified and compared across groups. Significant differences in the ROI-to-ROI analysis were followed up with voxelwise seed-based analyses to further localize thalamic dysconnectivity.
Results
ROI analysis revealed reduced PFC-thalamic connectivity and increased somatomotor-thalamic connectivity in both chronic and early-stage psychosis patients. PFC hypoconnectivity and motor cortex hyperconnectivity correlated in patients, suggesting that they result from a common pathophysiological mechanism. Seed-based analyses revealed thalamic hypoconnectivity in psychosis localized to dorsolateral PFC, medial PFC, and cerebellar areas of the well-described executive control network. Across all subjects, thalamic connectivity with areas of the fronto-parietal network correlated with cognitive functioning, including verbal learning and memory.
Conclusions
Thalamocortical dysconnectivity is present in both chronic and early stages of psychosis, includes reduced thalamic connectivity with the executive control network, and is related to cognitive impairment.},

This article reviews the growing literature on the development of functional networks, from infancy through adolescence, as measured by resting-state functional connectivity MRI. We note several limitations of traditional approaches to describing brain networks and describe a powerful framework for analyzing networks, called graph theory. We argue that characterization of the development of brain systems (e.g., the default mode network) should be comprehensive, considering not only relationships within a given system, but also how these relationships are situated within wider network contexts. We note that, despite substantial reorganization of functional connectivity, several large-scale network properties appear to be preserved across development, suggesting that functional brain networks, even in children, are organized in manners similar to other complex systems.},

Using a fractal n-back fMRI paradigm, we investigated brain responses to WM load in 951 human youths aged 8–22 years. Compared with more limited associations with age, WM performance was robustly associated with both executive network activation and deactivation of the default mode network. Multivariate patterns of brain activation predicted task performance with a high degree of accuracy, and also mediated the observed age-related improvements in WM performance. These results delineate a process of functional maturation of the executive system, and suggest that this process allows for the improvement of cognitive capability seen during adolescence.},

	abstract = {A critical issue in many neuroimaging studies is the comparison between brain maps. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how one should test hypotheses focused on the overlap or spatial correspondence between two or more brain maps. This “correspondence problem” affects, for example, the interpretation of comparisons between task-based patterns of functional activation, resting-state networks or modules, and neuroanatomical landmarks. To date, this problem has been addressed with remarkable variability in terms of methodological approaches and statistical rigor. In this paper, we address the correspondence problem using a spatial permutation framework to generate null models of overlap by applying random rotations to spherical representations of the cortical surface, an approach for which we also provide a theoretical statistical foundation. We use this method to derive clusters of cognitive functions that are correlated in terms of their functional neuroatomical substrates. In addition, using publicly available data, we formally demonstrate the correspondence between maps of task-based functional activity, resting-state fMRI networks and gyral-based anatomical landmarks. We provide open-access code to implement the methods presented for two commonly-used tools for surface based cortical analysis (https://www.github.com/spin-test). This spatial permutation approach constitutes a useful advance over widely-used methods for the comparison of cortical maps, thereby opening new possibilities for the integration of diverse neuroimaging data.},

However, studies of brain development in youth have focused on describing how cortical thickness varies over large-scale functional and anatomic regions. How the relationship between thickness and local sulcal topology arises in development is still not well understood. Here, we investigated the spatial relationships between cortical thickness, folding, and underlying white matter organization to elucidate the influence of local topology on human brain development. Our approach included using both T1-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a cross-sectional sample of 932 youths ages 8–21 studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Principal components analysis revealed separable development-related processes of regionally specific nonlinear cortical thickening (from ages 8–14) and widespread linear cortical thinning that have dissociable relationships with cortical topology. Whereas cortical thinning was most prominent in the depths of the sulci, early cortical thickening was present on the gyri. Furthermore, decline in mean diffusivity calculated from DTI in underlying white matter was correlated with cortical thinning, suggesting that cortical thinning is spatially associated with white matter development. Spatial permutation tests were used to assess the significance of these relationships. Together, these data demonstrate that cortical remodeling during youth occurs on a local topological scale and is associated with changes in white matter beneath the cortical surface.},

The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly.},

	abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. Here, the authors propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. The authors show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, the authors show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

Since these nuclei are known to have different functions and to be connected to different areas of the cerebral cortex, it is of great interest for the neuroimaging community to study their volume, shape and connectivity in vivo with MRI. In this study, we present a probabilistic atlas of the thalamic nuclei built using ex vivo brain MRI scans and histological data, as well as the application of the atlas to in vivo MRI segmentation. The atlas was built using manual delineation of 26 thalamic nuclei on the serial histology of 12 whole thalami from six autopsy samples, combined with manual segmentations of the whole thalamus and surrounding structures (caudate, putamen, hippocampus, etc.) made on in vivo brain MR data from 39 subjects. The 3D structure of the histological data and corresponding manual segmentations was recovered using the ex vivo MRI as reference frame, and stacks of blockface photographs acquired during the sectioning as intermediate target. The atlas, which was encoded as an adaptive tetrahedral mesh, shows a good agreement with previous histological studies of the thalamus in terms of volumes of representative nuclei. When applied to segmentation of in vivo scans using Bayesian inference, the atlas shows excellent test-retest reliability, robustness to changes in input MRI contrast, and ability to detect differential thalamic effects in subjects with Alzheimer's disease.

In particular, the impact of spatiotemporal data resolution on the resulting connectivity findings has not been sufficiently investigated. In fact, a number of studies have already observed that functional networks often give different conclusions across different parcellation scales. If the interpretations from functional networks are inconsistent across spatiotemporal scales, then the whole validity of the functional network paradigm is called into question. This paper investigates the consistency of resting state network structure when using different temporal sampling or spatial parcellation, or different methods for constructing the networks. To pursue this, we develop a novel network comparison framework based on persistent homology from a topological data analysis. We use the new network comparison tools to characterize the spatial and temporal scales under which consistent functional networks can be constructed. The methods are illustrated on Human Connectome Project data, showing that the DISCOH2 network construction method outperforms other approaches at most data spatiotemporal resolutions.},

Then, second, relevant experts, sketch a number of emerging methods, which can break through these limitations. In particular we discuss five such methods.

	abstract = {A new methodology is proposed for estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses in a large collection of tests. Each test concerns a single parameter δ whose value is specified by the null hypothesis. We combine a parametric model for the conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the p-value given δ with a nonparametric spline model for the density g(δ) of δ under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion of true null hypotheses and the coefficients in the spline model are estimated by penalized least squares subject to constraints that guarantee that the spline is a density. The estimator is computed efficiently using quadratic programming. Our methodology produces an estimate of the density of δ when the null is false and can address such questions as “when the null is false, is the parameter usually close to the null or far away?” This leads us to define a falsely interesting discovery rate (FIDR), a generalization of the false discovery rate. We contrast the FIDR approach to Efron's (2004, Journal of the American Statistical Association99, 96–104) empirical null hypothesis technique. We discuss the use of in sample size calculations based on the expected discovery rate (EDR). Our recommended estimator of the proportion of true nulls has less bias compared to estimators based upon the marginal density of the p-values at 1. In a simulation study, we compare our estimators to the convex, decreasing estimator of Langaas, Lindqvist, and Ferkingstad (2005, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B67, 555–572). The most biased of our estimators is very similar in performance to the convex, decreasing estimator. As an illustration, we analyze differences in gene expression between resistant and susceptible strains of barley.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Puberty is the defining process of adolescence, and is accompanied by divergent trajectories of behavior and cognition for males and females. Here we examine whether sex differences exist in the effect of puberty on the morphology of the hippocampus and amygdala.
METHOD: T1-weighted structural neuroimaging was performed in a sample of 524 pre- or postpubertal individuals ages 10 to 22 years. Hippocampal and amygdala volume and shape were quantified using the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) FIRST procedure and scaled by intracranial volume. The effects on regional volume of age, sex, puberty, and their interactions were examined using linear regression. Postpubertal sex differences were examined using a vertex analysis.
RESULTS: Prepubertal males and females had similar hippocampal volumes, whereas postpubertal females had significantly larger bilateral hippocampi, resulting in a significant puberty-by-sex interaction even when controlling for age and age-by-sex. This effect was regionally specific and was not apparent in the amygdala. Vertex analysis revealed that postpubertal differences were most prominent in the lateral aspect of the hippocampus bilaterally, corresponding to the CA1 subfield.
CONCLUSIONS: These results establish that there are regionally specific sex differences in the effect of puberty on the hippocampus. These findings are relevant for the understanding of psychiatric disorders that have both hippocampal dysfunction and prominent gender disparities during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses, π0, has attracted much attention in the recent statistical literature. Besides its apparent relevance for a set of specific scientific hypotheses, an accurate estimate of this parameter is key for many multiple testing procedures. Most existing methods for estimating π0 in the literature are motivated from the independence assumption of test statistics, which is often not true in reality. Simulations indicate that most existing estimators in the presence of the dependence among test statistics can be poor, mainly due to the increase of variation in these estimators. In this paper, we propose several data-driven methods for estimating π0 by incorporating the distribution pattern of the observed p-values as a practical approach to address potential dependence among test statistics. Specifically, we use a linear fit to give a data-driven estimate for the proportion of true-null p-values in (λ, 1] over the whole range [0, 1] instead of using the expected proportion at 1 − λ. We find that the proposed estimators may substantially decrease the variance of the estimated true null proportion and thus improve the overall performance.},

The procedure given there was shown to control the FDR for independent test statistics. When some of the hypotheses are in fact false, that procedure is too conservative. We present here an adaptive procedure, where the number of true null hypotheses is estimated first as in Hochberg and Benjamini (1990), and this estimate is used in the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). The result is still a simple stepwise procedure, to which we also give a graphical companion. The new procedure is used in several examples drawn from educational and behavioral studies, addressing problems in multi-center studies, subset analysis and meta-analysis. The examples vary in the number of hypotheses tested, and the implication of the new procedure on the conclusions. In a large simulation study of independent test statistics the adaptive procedure is shown to control the FDR and have substantially better power than the previously suggested FDR controlling method, which by itself is more powerful than the traditional family wise error-rate controlling methods. In cases where most of the tested hypotheses are far from being true there is hardly any penalty due to the simultaneous testing of many hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Data quality is increasingly recognized as one of the most important confounding factors in brain imaging research. It is particularly important for studies of brain development, where age is systematically related to in-scanner motion and data quality. Prior work has demonstrated that in-scanner head motion biases estimates of structural neuroimaging measures. However, objective measures of data quality are not available for most structural brain images. Here we sought to identify quantitative measures of data quality for T1-weighted volumes, describe how these measures relate to cortical thickness, and delineate how this in turn may bias inference regarding associations with age in youth. Three highly-trained raters provided manual ratings of 1840 raw T1-weighted volumes. These images included a training set of 1065 images from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), a test set of 533 images from the PNC, as well as an external test set of 242 adults acquired on a different scanner. Manual ratings were compared to automated quality measures provided by the Preprocessed Connectomes Project's Quality Assurance Protocol (QAP), as well as FreeSurfer's Euler number, which summarizes the topological complexity of the reconstructed cortical surface. Results revealed that the Euler number was consistently correlated with manual ratings across samples. Furthermore, the Euler number could be used to identify images scored “unusable” by human raters with a high degree of accuracy (AUC: 0.98–0.99), and out-performed proxy measures from functional timeseries acquired in the same scanning session. The Euler number also was significantly related to cortical thickness in a regionally heterogeneous pattern that was consistent across datasets and replicated prior results. Finally, data quality both inflated and obscured associations with age during adolescence. Taken together, these results indicate that reliable measures of data quality can be automatically derived from T1-weighted volumes, and that failing to control for data quality can systematically bias the results of studies of brain maturation.},

Using a multi-study approach, we investigated whether there are brain regions that show a general relationship between trial-by-trial RT variability and activation across a range of cognitive tasks. Methodology/Principal Findings The relation between trial-by-trial differences in RT and brain activation was modeled in five different fMRI datasets spanning a range of experimental tasks and stimulus modalities. Three main findings were identified. First, in a widely distributed set of gray and white matter regions, activation was delayed on trials with long RTs relative to short RTs, suggesting delayed initiation of underlying physiological processes. Second, in lateral and medial frontal regions, activation showed a “time-on-task” effect, increasing linearly as a function of RT. Finally, RT variability reliably modulated the BOLD signal not only in gray matter but also in diffuse regions of white matter. Conclusions/Significance The results highlight the importance of modeling trial-by-trial RT in fMRI analyses and raise the possibility that RT variability may provide a powerful probe for investigating the previously elusive white matter BOLD signal.},

	abstract = {Obtaining quantitative measures from biomedical images often requires segmentation, i.e., finding and outlining the structures of interest. Multi-modality imaging datasets, in which multiple imaging measures are available at each spatial location, are increasingly common, particularly in MRI. In applications where fully automatic segmentation algorithms are unavailable or fail to perform at desired levels of accuracy, semi-automatic segmentation can be a time-saving alternative to manual segmentation, allowing the human expert to guide segmentation, while minimizing the effort expended by the expert on repetitive tasks that can be automated. However, few existing 3D image analysis tools support semi-automatic segmentation of multi-modality imaging data. This paper describes new extensions to the ITK-SNAP interactive image visualization and segmentation tool that support semi-automatic segmentation of multi-modality imaging datasets in a way that utilizes information from all available modalities simultaneously. The approach combines Random Forest classifiers, trained by the user by placing several brushstrokes in the image, with the active contour segmentation algorithm. The new multi-modality semi-automatic segmentation approach is evaluated in the context of high-grade glioblastoma segmentation.},

To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing.

	abstract = {The false discovery rate (FDR), or the expected proportion of falsely rejected null hypotheses to rejected null hypotheses, has recently been proposed as an error rate that multiple testing procedures should in certain circumstances control. So far, only a step-up procedure for independent test statistics has been created explicitly to control the FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). In this paper, step-down and step-up procedures are described which asymptotically (as N→∞) control the FDR when the test statistics are the t statistics from consistent multivariate normal estimators of the tested parameters. Determination of the necessary critical constants for the normal theory procedures is achieved using numerical integration when the correlations are equal, or through simulation using the multivariate t distribution when the correlations are arbitrary. The critical constants of the normal theory procedures are compared to those of the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure under the normal assumption, and a large potential power increase is found. Simulation strongly supports the use of critical constants, obtained by an asymptotic argument, in small samples for as many as 30 tests. Adjusted FDR values can be found to quantify the evidence against a given hypothesis.},

Further, graph measures of the areal network indicate that the default mode subgraph shares network properties with sensory and motor subgraphs: it is internally integrated but isolated from other subgraphs, much like a “processing” system.

The smoothing parameter is updated jointly with the estimate in a performance-oriented iteration via a cross-validation performance estimate, where the performance is measured by proxies of the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler distance between the true density and the estimate. Simulations of limited scale are conducted to examine the relative effectiveness of the automatic smoothing parameter selection procedure and to assess the practical statistical performance of the methodology in general. The method is also applied to some real data sets. The algorithm is implemented in a few Ratfor routines, which will be included in later versions of RKPACK for public access.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

We show how and explain why an unrestricted weighted least squares estimator is superior to conventional random-effects meta-analysis when there is publication (or small-sample) bias and better than a fixed-effect weighted average if there is heterogeneity. Statistical theory and simulations of effect sizes, log odds ratios and regression coefficients demonstrate that this unrestricted weighted least squares estimator provides satisfactory estimates and confidence intervals that are comparable to random effects when there is no publication (or small-sample) bias and identical to fixed-effect meta-analysis when there is no heterogeneity. When there is publication selection bias, the unrestricted weighted least squares approach dominates random effects; when there is excess heterogeneity, it is clearly superior to fixed-effect meta-analysis. In practical applications, an unrestricted weighted least squares weighted average will often provide superior estimates to both conventional fixed and random effects.

Suppose that two sets of measurements are available on the same set of observations. Sparse CCA is a method for identifying sparse linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are highly correlated with each other. It has been shown to be useful in the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, when two sets of assays are available on the same set of samples. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the sparse CCA methodology. (1) Sparse CCA is an unsupervised method; that is, it does not make use of outcome measurements that may be available for each observation (e.g., survival time or cancer subtype). We propose an extension to sparse CCA, which we call sparse supervised CCA, which results in the identification of linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are correlated with each other and associated with the outcome. (2) It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to collect data on more than two assays on the same set of samples; for instance, SNP, gene expression, and DNA copy number measurements may all be available. We develop sparse multiple CCA in order to extend the sparse CCA methodology to the case of more than two data sets. We demonstrate these new methods on simulated data and on a recently published and publicly available diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set.},

Modern activation studies often compare localized task-induced changes in brain activity between experimental groups. Complementary approaches consider the ensemble of voxels constituting an anatomically defined region of interest (ROI) or summary statistics, such as means or quantiles, of the ROI. In this work, we present a Bayesian extension of voxel-level analyses that offers several notable benefits. Among these, it combines whole-brain voxel-by-voxel modeling and ROI analyses within a unified framework. Secondly, an unstructured variance/covariance matrix for regional mean parameters allows for the study of inter-regional (long-range) correlations, and the model employs an exchangeable correlation structure to capture intra-regional (short-range) correlations. Estimation is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques implemented via Gibbs sampling. We apply our Bayesian hierarchical model to two novel fMRI data sets: one considering inhibitory control in cocaine-dependent men and the second considering verbal memory in subjects at high risk for Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {The problem of multiple testing for the presence of signal in spatial data can involve numerous locations. Traditionally, each location is tested separately for signal presence, but then the findings are reported in terms of clusters of nearby locations. This is an indication that the units of interest for testing are clusters rather than individual locations. The investigator may know a priori these more natural units or an approximation to them. We suggest testing these cluster units rather than individual locations, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio within the unit tested as well as reducing the number of hypothesis tests conducted. Because the signal may be absent from part of each cluster, we define a cluster as containing a signal if the signal is present somewhere within the cluster. We suggest controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) on clusters (i.e., the expected proportion of clusters rejected erroneously out of all clusters rejected) or its extension to general weights (WFDR). We introduce a powerful two-stage testing procedure and show that it controls the WFDR. Once the cluster discoveries have been made, we suggest "cleaning" locations in which the signal is absent. For this purpose, we develop a hierarchical testing procedure that first tests clusters, then tests locations within rejected clusters. We show formally that this procedure controls the desired location error rate asymptotically, and conjecture that this is also so for realistic settings by extensive simulations. We discuss an application to functional neuroimaging that motivated this research and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methodology on an example.},

	abstract = {Nonparametric hypothesis testing for a spatial signal can involve a large number of hypotheses. For instance, two satellite images of the same scene, taken before and after an event, could be used to test a hypothesis that the event has no environmental impact. This is equivalent to testing that the mean difference of “after-before” is zero at each of the (typically thousands of) pixels that make up the scene. In such a situation, conventional testing procedures that control the overall type I error deteriorate as the number of hypotheses increases. Powerful testing procedures are needed for this problem of testing for the presence of a spatial signal. In this article we propose a procedure called enhanced false discovery rate (EFDR), which is based on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and a concept known as generalized degrees of freedom. EFDR differs from the standard FDR procedure by reducing the number of hypotheses tested. This is done in two ways: first, the model is represented more parsimoniously in the wavelet domain; second, an optimal selection of hypotheses is made using a criterion based on generalized degrees of freedom. Not only does the EFDR procedure tell us whether a spatial signal is present, but, if a signal is deemed present, it can also indicate its location and magnitude. We examine EFDR's operating characteristics and in simulations show that it outperforms the standard FDR and conventional testing procedures. Finally, we apply the EFDR procedure to an air temperature dataset generated from the climate system model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in which air temperatures in the 1980s are compared to those in the 1990s. We conclude that temperature change has occurred between the two decades, mostly warming in the central part of the United States and in coastal regions of South America at about 20°S.},

	abstract = {This paper contains a new approach toward a theory of robust estimation; it treats in detail the asymptotic theory of estimating a location parameter for contaminated normal distributions, and exhibits estimators--intermediaries between sample mean and sample median--that are asymptotically most robust (in a sense to be specified) among all translation invariant estimators. For the general background, see Tukey (1960) (p. 448 ff.) Let x1,⋯,xnx1,⋯,xnx\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, x\_n be independent random variables with common distribution function F(t−ξ)F(t−ξ)F(t - {\textbackslash}xi). The problem is to estimate the location parameter ξξ{\textbackslash}xi, but with the complication that the prototype distribution F(t)F(t)F(t) is only approximately known. I shall primarily be concerned with the model of indeterminacy F=(1−ϵ)Φ+ϵHF=(1−ϵ)Φ+ϵHF = (1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon){\textbackslash}Phi + {\textbackslash}epsilon H, where 0≦ϵ{\textless}10≦ϵ{\textless}10 {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon {\textless} 1 is a known number, Φ(t)=(2π)−12∫t−∞exp(−12s2)dsΦ(t)=(2π)−12∫−∞texp⁡(−12s2)ds{\textbackslash}Phi(t) = (2{\textbackslash}pi){\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\} {\textbackslash}int{\textasciicircum}t\_\{-{\textbackslash}infty\} {\textbackslash}exp(-{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}s{\textasciicircum}2) ds is the standard normal cumulative and HHH is an unknown contaminating distribution. This model arises for instance if the observations are assumed to be normal with variance 1, but a fraction ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon of them is affected by gross errors. Later on, I shall also consider other models of indeterminacy, e.g., supt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ(t){\textbar}≦ϵsupt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ(t){\textbar}≦ϵ{\textbackslash}sup\_t {\textbar}F(t) - {\textbackslash}Phi(t){\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon. Some inconvenience is caused by the fact that location and scale parameters are not uniquely determined: in general, for fixed ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon, there will be several values of ξξ{\textbackslash}xi and σσ{\textbackslash}sigma such that supt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ((t−ξ)/σ){\textbar}≦ϵsupt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ((t−ξ)/σ){\textbar}≦ϵ{\textbackslash}sup\_t{\textbar}F(t) - {\textbackslash}Phi((t - {\textbackslash}xi)/{\textbackslash}sigma){\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon, and similarly for the contaminated case. Although this inherent and unavoidable indeterminacy is small if ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon is small and is rather irrelevant for practical purposes, it poses awkward problems for the theory, especially for optimality questions. To remove this difficulty, one may either (i) restrict attention to symmetric distributions, and estimate the location of the center of symmetry (this works for ξξ{\textbackslash}xi but not for σσ{\textbackslash}sigma); or (ii) one may define the parameter to be estimated in terms of the estimator itself, namely by its asymptotic value for sample size n→∞n→∞n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty; or (iii) one may define the parameters by arbitrarily chosen functionals of the distribution (e.g., by the expectation, or the median of FFF). All three possibilities have unsatisfactory aspects, and I shall usually choose the variant which is mathematically most convenient. It is interesting to look back to the very origin of the theory of estimation, namely to Gauss and his theory of least squares. Gauss was fully aware that his main reason for assuming an underlying normal distribution and a quadratic loss function was mathematical, i.e., computational, convenience. In later times, this was often forgotten, partly because of the central limit theorem. However, if one wants to be honest, the central limit theorem can at most explain why many distributions occurring in practice are approximately normal. The stress is on the word "approximately." This raises a question which could have been asked already by Gauss, but which was, as far as I know, only raised a few years ago (notably by Tukey): What happens if the true distribution deviates slightly from the assumed normal one? As is now well known, the sample mean then may have a catastrophically bad performance: seemingly quite mild deviations may already explode its variance. Tukey and others proposed several more robust substitutes--trimmed means, Winsorized means, etc.--and explored their performance for a few typical violations of normality. A general theory of robust estimation is still lacking; it is hoped that the present paper will furnish the first few steps toward such a theory. At the core of the method of least squares lies the idea to minimize the sum of the squared "errors," that is, to adjust the unknown parameters such that the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and computed values is minimized. In the simplest case, with which we are concerned here, namely the estimation of a location parameter, one has to minimize the expression ∑i(xi−T)2∑i(xi−T)2{\textbackslash}sum\_i (x\_i - T){\textasciicircum}2; this is of course achieved by the sample mean T=∑ixi/nT=∑ixi/nT = {\textbackslash}sum\_i x\_i/n. I should like to emphasize that no loss function is involved here; I am only describing how the least squares estimator is defined, and neither the underlying family of distributions nor the true value of the parameter to be estimated enters so far. It is quite natural to ask whether one can obtain more robustness by minimizing another function of the errors than the sum of their squares. We shall therefore concentrate our attention to estimators that can be defined by a minimum principle of the form (for a location parameter): T=Tn(x1,⋯,xn)minimizes∑iρ(xi−T),T=Tn(x1,⋯,xn)minimizes∑iρ(xi−T),T = T\_n(x\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, x\_n) minimizes {\textbackslash}sum\_i {\textbackslash}rho(x\_i - T), whereρisanon−constantfunction.(M)(M)whereρisanon−constantfunction.{\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\} {\textbackslash}tag\{M\} where {\textbackslash}rho is a non-constant function. {\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} Of course, this definition generalizes at once to more general least squares type problems, where several parameters have to be determined. This class of estimators contains in particular (i) the sample mean (ρ(t)=t2)(ρ(t)=t2)({\textbackslash}rho(t) = t{\textasciicircum}2), (ii) the sample median (ρ(t)={\textbar}t{\textbar})(ρ(t)={\textbar}t{\textbar})({\textbackslash}rho(t) = {\textbar}t{\textbar}), and more generally, (iii) all maximum likelihood estimators (ρ(t)=−logf(t)(ρ(t)=−log⁡f(t)({\textbackslash}rho(t) = -{\textbackslash}log f(t), where fff is the assumed density of the untranslated distribution). These (MMM)-estimators, as I shall call them for short, have rather pleasant asymptotic properties; sufficient conditions for asymptotic normality and an explicit expression for their asymptotic variance will be given. How should one judge the robustness of an estimator Tn(x)=Tn(x1,⋯,xn)Tn(x)=Tn(x1,⋯,xn)T\_n(x) = T\_n(x\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, x\_n)? Since ill effects from contamination are mainly felt for large sample sizes, it seems that one should primarily optimize large sample robustness properties. Therefore, a convenient measure of robustness for asymptotically normal estimators seems to be the supremum of the asymptotic variance (n→∞)(n→∞)(n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty) when FFF ranges over some suitable set of underlying distributions, in particular over the set of all F=(1−ϵ)Φ+ϵHF=(1−ϵ)Φ+ϵHF = (1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon){\textbackslash}Phi + {\textbackslash}epsilon H for fixed ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon and symmetric HHH. On second thought, it turns out that the asymptotic variance is not only easier to handle, but that even for moderate values of nnn it is a better measure of performance than the actual variance, because (i) the actual variance of an estimator depends very much on the behavior of the tails of HHH, and the supremum of the actual variance is infinite for any estimator whose value is always contained in the convex hull of the observations. (ii) If an estimator is asymptotically normal, then the important central part of its distribution and confidence intervals for moderate confidence levels can better be approximated in terms of the asymptotic variance than in terms of the actual variance. If we adopt this measure of robustness, and if we restrict attention to (MMM)-estimators, then it will be shown that the most robust estimator is uniquely determined and corresponds to the following ρ:ρ(t)=12t2ρ:ρ(t)=12t2{\textbackslash}rho:{\textbackslash}rho(t) = {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}t{\textasciicircum}2 for {\textbar}t{\textbar}{\textless}k,ρ(t)=k{\textbar}t{\textbar}−12k2{\textbar}t{\textbar}{\textless}k,ρ(t)=k{\textbar}t{\textbar}−12k2{\textbar}t{\textbar} {\textless} k, {\textbackslash}rho(t) = k{\textbar}t{\textbar} - {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}k{\textasciicircum}2 for {\textbar}t{\textbar}≧k{\textbar}t{\textbar}≧k{\textbar}t{\textbar} {\textbackslash}geqq k, with kkk depending on ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon. This estimator is most robust even among all translation invariant estimators. Sample mean (k=∞)(k=∞)(k = {\textbackslash}infty) and sample median (k=0)(k=0)(k = 0) are limiting cases corresponding to ϵ=0ϵ=0{\textbackslash}epsilon = 0 and ϵ=1ϵ=1{\textbackslash}epsilon = 1, respectively, and the estimator is closely related and asymptotically equivalent to Winsorizing. I recall the definition of Winsorizing: assume that the observations have been ordered, x1≦x2≦⋯≦xnx1≦x2≦⋯≦xnx\_1 {\textbackslash}leqq x\_2 {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}cdots {\textbackslash}leqq x\_n, then the statistic T=n−1(gxg+1+xg+1+xg+2+⋯+xn−h+hxn−h)T=n−1(gxg+1+xg+1+xg+2+⋯+xn−h+hxn−h)T = n{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}(gx\_\{g + 1\} + x\_\{g + 1\} + x\_\{g + 2\} + {\textbackslash}cdots + x\_\{n - h\} + hx\_\{n - h\}) is called the Winsorized mean, obtained by Winsorizing the ggg leftmost and the hhh rightmost observations. The above most robust (MMM)-estimators can be described by the same formula, except that in the first and in the last summand, the factors xg+1xg+1x\_\{g + 1\} and xn−hxn−hx\_\{n - h\} have to be replaced by some numbers u,vu,vu, v satisfying xg≦u≦xg+1xg≦u≦xg+1x\_g {\textbackslash}leqq u {\textbackslash}leqq x\_\{g + 1\} and xn−h≦v≦xn−h+1xn−h≦v≦xn−h+1x\_\{n - h\} {\textbackslash}leqq v {\textbackslash}leqq x\_\{n - h + 1\}, respectively; g,h,ug,h,ug, h, u and vvv depend on the sample. In fact, this (MMM)-estimator is the maximum likelihood estimator corresponding to a unique least favorable distribution F0F0F\_0 with density f0(t)=(1−ϵ)(2π)−12e−ρ(t)f0(t)=(1−ϵ)(2π)−12e−ρ(t)f\_0(t) = (1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon)(2{\textbackslash}pi){\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\}e{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}rho(t)\}. This f0f0f\_0 behaves like a normal density for small ttt, like an exponential density for large ttt. At least for me, this was rather surprising--I would have expected an f0f0f\_0 with much heavier tails. This result is a particular case of a more general one that can be stated roughly as follows: Assume that FFF belongs to some convex set CCC of distribution functions. Then the most robust (MMM)-estimator for the set CCC coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator for the unique F0εCF0εCF\_0 {\textbackslash}varepsilon C which has the smallest Fisher information number I(F)=∫(f′/f)2fdtI(F)=∫(f′/f)2fdtI(F) = {\textbackslash}int (f'/f){\textasciicircum}2f dt among all FεCFεCF {\textbackslash}varepsilon C. Miscellaneous related problems will also be treated: the case of non-symmetric contaminating distributions; the most robust estimator for the model of indeterminacy supt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ(t){\textbar}≦ϵsupt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ(t){\textbar}≦ϵ{\textbackslash}sup\_t{\textbar}F(t) - {\textbackslash}Phi(t){\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon; robust estimation of a scale parameter; how to estimate location, if scale and ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon are unknown; numerical computation of the estimators; more general estimators, e.g., minimizing ∑i{\textless}jρ(xi−T,xj−T)∑i{\textless}jρ(xi−T,xj−T){\textbackslash}sum\_\{i {\textless} j\} {\textbackslash}rho(x\_i - T, x\_j - T), where ρρ{\textbackslash}rho is a function of two arguments. Questions of small sample size theory will not be touched in this paper.},

These are both examples of functional data, which has become a commonly encountered type of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is functional principal component analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool, and in sparse data situations it can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single- or multiple- index methods, we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models and models that feature time warping, manifold learning, and empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

	abstract = {Scientists and others today often collect samples of curves and other functional observations. This monograph presents many ideas and techniques for such data. Included are expressions in the functional domain of such classics as linear regression, principal components analysis, linear modeling, and canonical correlation analysis, as well as specifically functional techniques such as curve registration and principal differential analysis. Data arising in real applications are used throughout for both motivation and illustration, showing how functional approaches allow us to see new things, especially by exploiting the smoothness of the processes generating the data. The data sets exemplify the wide scope of functional data analysis; they are drawn from growth analysis, meteorology, biomechanics, equine science, economics, and medicine. The book presents novel statistical technology, much of it based on the authors’ own research work, while keeping the mathematical level widely accessible. It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields. This second edition is aimed at a wider range of readers, and especially those who would like to apply these techniques to their research problems. It complements the authors' other recent volume Applied Functional Data Analysis: Methods and Case Studies. In particular, there is an extended coverage of data smoothing and other matters arising in the preliminaries to a functional data analysis. The chapters on the functional linear model and modeling of the dynamics of systems through the use of differential equations and principal differential analysis have been completely rewritten and extended to include new developments. Other chapters have been revised substantially, often to give more weight to examples and practical considerations.

	abstract = {Despite considerable evidence showing thalamus anatomy and connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia, how these abnormalities are reflected in thalamus function during cognition is relatively understudied. Modulation of thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is required for higher-order cognitive processes, which are often impaired in schizophrenia. To address this gap, we investigated how thalamus function and thalamus-PFC connectivity under different levels of cognitive demand may be disrupted in schizophrenia. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while performing an event-related two-alternative forced choice task under Single and Dual task conditions. In the Single task condition, participants responded either to a visual cue with a well-learned motor response, or an audio cue with a well-learned vocal response. In the Dual task condition, participants performed both tasks. Thalamic connectivity with task relevant regions of the PFC for each condition was measured using beta-series correlation. Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrated less modulation of both mediodorsal thalamus activation and thalamus-PFC connectivity with increased cognitive demand. In contrast, their ability to modulate PFC function during task performance was maintained. These results suggest that the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is associated with thalamus-PFC circuitry and suggests that the thalamus, along with the PFC, should be a focus of investigation.},

Here we introduce a novel extension of the p-value—a second-generation p-value (pδ)–that formally accounts for scientific relevance and leverages this natural Type I Error control. The approach relies on a pre-specified interval null hypothesis that represents the collection of effect sizes that are scientifically uninteresting or are practically null. The second-generation p-value is the proportion of data-supported hypotheses that are also null hypotheses. As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the data are compatible with null hypotheses (pδ = 1), or with alternative hypotheses (pδ = 0), or when the data are inconclusive (0 {\textless} pδ {\textless} 1). Moreover, second-generation p-values provide a proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive. Second-generation p-values promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori specifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with alternative or null hypotheses.},

All versions of this article have been corrected.] The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association, 2001, American Psychological Association, 2010) calls for the reporting of effect sizes and their confidence intervals. Estimates of effect size are useful for determining the practical or theoretical importance of an effect, the relative contributions of factors, and the power of an analysis. We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size. The most often reported analysis was analysis of variance, and almost half of these reports were not accompanied by effect sizes. Partial η2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance. For t tests, 2/3 of the articles did not report an associated effect size estimate; Cohen's d was the most often reported. We provide a straightforward guide to understanding, selecting, calculating, and interpreting effect sizes for many types of data and to methods for calculating effect size confidence intervals and power analysis.

	abstract = {Estimation of effect size is of interest in many applied fields such as Psychology, Sociology and Education. However there are few nonparametric estimators of effect size proposed in the existing literature, and little is known about the distributional characteristics of these estimators. In this article, two estimators based on the sample quantiles are proposed and studied. The first one is the estimator suggested by Hedges and Olkin (see page 93 of Hedges \& Olkin, 1985) for the situation where a treatment effect is evaluated against a control group (Case A). A modified version of the robust estimator by Hedges and Olkin is also proposed for the situation where two parallel treatments are compared (Case B). Large sample distributions of both estimators are derived. Their asymptotic relative efficiencies with respect to the normal maximum likelihood estimators under several common distributions are evaluated. The robust properties of the proposed estimators are discussed with respect to the sample-wise breakdown points proposed by Akritas (1991). Simulation studies are provided in which the performing characteristics of the proposed estimator are compared to that of the nonparametric estimators by Kraemer and Andrews (1982). Interval estimation of the effect sizes is also discussed. In an example, interval estimates for the data set in Kraemer and Andrews (1982) are calculated for both cases A and B.},

We address this issue head-on by asking a specific question: Across what domain, specifically, do we wish to control the Type I error rate? For example, do we wish to control it across all of science, across all of a specific discipline such as psychology, across a researcher's active lifetime, across a substantive research area, across an experiment, or across a set of hypotheses? In attempting to answer these questions, we show that each one leads to troubling dilemmas wherein controlling the Type I error rate turns out to be inconsistent with other scientific desiderata. This inconsistency implies that we must make a choice. In our view, the other scientific desiderata are much more valuable than controlling the Type I error rate and so it is the latter, rather than the former, with which we must dispense. But by doing so—that is, by eliminating the Type I error justification for computing and using p-values—there is even less reason to believe that p is useful for validly rejecting null hypotheses than previous critics have suggested.},

A separate meta-analysis of each type of outcome results in loss of information and may be misleading. It is shown that a ln(odds ratio) can be converted to effect size by dividing by 1.81. The validity of effect size, the estimate of interest divided by the residual standard deviation, depends on comparable variation across studies. If researchers routinely report residual standard deviation, any subsequent review can combine both odds ratios and effect sizes in a single meta-analysis when this is justified.

	abstract = {The human brain is a complex system whose topological organization can be represented using connectomics. Recent studies have shown that human connectomes can be constructed using various neuroimaging technologies and further characterized using sophisticated analytic strategies, such as graph theory. These methods reveal the intriguing topological architectures of human brain networks in healthy populations and explore the changes throughout normal development and aging and under various pathological conditions. However, given the huge complexity of this methodology, toolboxes for graph-based network visualization are still lacking. Here, using MATLAB with a graphical user interface (GUI), we developed a graph-theoretical network visualization toolbox, called BrainNet Viewer, to illustrate human connectomes as ball-and-stick models. Within this toolbox, several combinations of defined files with connectome information can be loaded to display different combinations of brain surface, nodes and edges. In addition, display properties, such as the color and size of network elements or the layout of the figure, can be adjusted within a comprehensive but easy-to-use settings panel. Moreover, BrainNet Viewer draws the brain surface, nodes and edges in sequence and displays brain networks in multiple views, as required by the user. The figure can be manipulated with certain interaction functions to display more detailed information. Furthermore, the figures can be exported as commonly used image file formats or demonstration video for further use. BrainNet Viewer helps researchers to visualize brain networks in an easy, flexible and quick manner, and this software is freely available on the NITRC website (www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/).},

	abstract = {Medical imaging has shown that, during early development, the brain undergoes more changes in size, shape and appearance than at any other time in life. A better understanding of brain development requires a spatio-temporal atlas that characterizes the dynamic changes during this period. In this paper we present an approach for constructing a 4D atlas of the developing brain, between 28 and 44weeks post-menstrual age at time of scan, using T1 and T2 weighted MR images from 204 premature neonates. The method used for the creation of the average 4D atlas utilizes non-rigid registration between all pairs of images to eliminate bias in the atlas toward any of the original images. In addition, kernel regression is used to produce age-dependent anatomical templates. A novelty in our approach is the use of a time-varying kernel width, to overcome the variations in the distribution of subjects at different ages. This leads to an atlas that retains a consistent level of detail at every time-point. Comparisons between the resulting atlas and atlases constructed using affine and non-rigid registration are presented. The resulting 4D atlas has greater anatomic definition than currently available 4D atlases created using various affine and non-rigid registration approaches, an important factor in improving registrations between the atlas and individual subjects. Also, the resulting 4D atlas can serve as a good representative of the population of interest as it reflects both global and local changes. The atlas is publicly available at www.brain-development.org.},

	abstract = {When planning most scientific studies, one of the first steps is to carry out a power analysis to define a design and sample size that will result in a well-powered study. There are limited resources for calculating power for group fMRI studies due to the complexity of the model. Previous approaches for group fMRI power calculation simplify the study design and/or the variance structure in order to make the calculation possible. These approaches limit the designs that can be studied and may result in inaccurate power calculations. We introduce a flexible power calculation model that makes fewer simplifying assumptions, leading to a more accurate power analysis that can be used on a wide variety of study designs. Our power calculation model can be used to obtain region of interest (ROI) summaries of the mean parameters and variance parameters, which can be use to increase understanding of the data as well as calculate power for a future study. Our example illustrates that minimizing cost to achieve 80\% power is not as simple as finding the smallest sample size capable of achieving 80\% power, since smaller sample sizes require each subject to be scanned longer.},

In this paper, we show how estimating the number of activated peaks or clusters enables one to estimate post-hoc how powerful the selection procedure performs. This procedure can be used in real studies as a diagnostics tool, and raises awareness on how much activation is potentially missed.

The choice of the model for the nuisance parameter can affect both the finite sample bias and efficiency of the resulting estimator of the parameter of interest. In this paper we propose a finite sample criterion based on cross validation that can be used to select a nuisance parameter model from a list of candidate models. We show that expected value of this criterion is minimized by the nuisance parameter model that yields the estimator of the parameter of interest with the smallest mean-squared error relative to the expected value of an initial consistent reference estimator. In a simulation study, we examine the performance of this criterion for selecting a model for a treatment mechanism in a marginal structural model (MSM) of point treatment data. For situations where all possible models cannot be evaluated, we outline a forward/backward model selection algorithm based on the cross validation criterion proposed in this paper and show how it can be used to select models for multiple nuisance parameters. Finally, we apply the forward model selection algorithm to a MSM analysis of the relationship between boiled water use and gastrointestinal illness in HIV positive men.},

The problem occurs in the derivation of information criteria for model comparison which often trade off ‘goodness of fit’ and ‘model complexity’. It also arises in (frequentist) attempts to estimate the error variance in regression models with informative priors on the regression coefficients, for example, in smoothing. It is argued that model complexity can be conceptualized as a feature of the joint distribution of the observed variables and the random parameters and might be formally described by a measure of dependence. The universal and accurate estimation of terms of model complexity is a challenging problem in practice. Several well-known criteria for model comparison are interpreted and discussed along these lines.},

I argue that versions of the classical, logical, propensity and subjectivist interpretations also fall prey to their own variants of the reference class problem. Other versions of these interpretations apparently evade the problem. But I contend that they are all “no-theory” theories of probability - accounts that leave quite obscure why probability should function as a guide to life, a suitable basis for rational inference and action. The reference class problem besets those theories that are genuinely informative and that plausibly constrain our inductive reasonings and decisions.I distinguish a “metaphysical” and an “epistemological” reference class problem. I submit that we can dissolve the former problem by recognizing that probability is fundamentally a two-place notion: conditional probability is the proper primitive of probability theory. However, I concede that the epistemological problem remains.},

	abstract = {Time series regression has been developed and long used to evaluate the short-term associations of air pollution and weather with mortality or morbidity of non-infectious diseases. The application of the regression approaches from this tradition to infectious diseases, however, is less well explored and raises some new issues. We discuss and present potential solutions for five issues often arising in such analyses: changes in immune population, strong autocorrelations, a wide range of plausible lag structures and association patterns, seasonality adjustments, and large overdispersion. The potential approaches are illustrated with datasets of cholera cases and rainfall from Bangladesh and influenza and temperature in Tokyo. Though this article focuses on the application of the traditional time series regression to infectious diseases and weather factors, we also briefly introduce alternative approaches, including mathematical modeling, wavelet analysis, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Modifications proposed to standard time series regression practice include using sums of past cases as proxies for the immune population, and using the logarithm of lagged disease counts to control autocorrelation due to true contagion, both of which are motivated from “susceptible-infectious-recovered” (SIR) models. The complexity of lag structures and association patterns can often be informed by biological mechanisms and explored by using distributed lag non-linear models. For overdispersed models, alternative distribution models such as quasi-Poisson and negative binomial should be considered. Time series regression can be used to investigate dependence of infectious diseases on weather, but may need modifying to allow for features specific to this context.},

However, the mechanisms through which sensory stimuli may affect social functioning are not well understood. This study used fMRI to examine brain activity while interpreting communicative intent in 15 high-functioning youth with ASD and 16 age- and IQ-matched typically-developing (TD) controls. Participants completed the task with and without a tactile sensory distracter, and with and without instructions directing their attention to relevant social cues. When completing the task in the presence of the sensory distracter, TD youth showed increased activity in auditory language and frontal regions whereas ASD youth showed decreased activation in these areas. Instructions mitigated this effect such that ASD youth did not decrease activation during tactile stimulation; instead, the ASD group showed increased medial prefrontal activity. SOR severity modulated the effect of the tactile stimulus on social processing. Results demonstrate for the first time a neural mechanism through which sensory stimuli cause disruption of social cognition, and that attentional modulation can restore neural processing of social cues through prefrontal regulation. Findings have implications for novel, integrative interventions that incorporate attentional directives to target both sensory and social symptoms.},

Yet, it is currently unknown how variation in the OXTR relates to brain functioning in individuals with ASD, and, critically, whether neural endophenotypes vary as a function of aggregate genetic risk. Here, for we believe the first time, we use a multi-locus approach to examine how genetic variation across several OXTR single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect functional connectivity of the brain’s reward network. Using data from 41 children with ASD and 41 neurotypical children, we examined functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) – a hub of the reward network – focusing on how connectivity varies with OXTR risk-allele dosage. Youth with ASD showed reduced NAcc connectivity with other areas in the reward circuit as a function of increased OXTR risk-allele dosage, as well as a positive association between risk-allele dosage and symptom severity, whereas neurotypical youth showed increased NAcc connectivity with frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing. In addition, we found that increased NAcc-frontal cortex connectivity in typically developing youth was related to better scores on a standardized measure of social functioning. Our results indicate that cumulative genetic variation on the OXTR impacts reward system connectivity in both youth with ASD and neurotypical controls. By showing differential genetic effects on neuroendophenotypes, these pathways elucidate mechanisms of vulnerability versus resilience in carriers of disease-associated risk alleles.},

	abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z {\textless} 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of “clusters” of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as “threshold-free cluster enhancement” (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

	abstract = {Background
Motivated by an inconsistency between reports of high diagnosis-classification accuracies and known heterogeneity in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), this study assessed classification accuracy in studies of ADHD as a function of methodological factors that can bias results. We hypothesized that high classification results in ADHD diagnosis are inflated by methodological factors.
Methods
We reviewed 69 studies (of 95 studies identified) that used neuroimaging features to predict ADHD diagnosis. Based on reported methods, we assessed the prevalence of circular analysis, which inflates classification accuracy, and evaluated the relationship between sample size and accuracy to test if small-sample models tend to report higher classification accuracy, also an indicator of bias.
Results
Circular analysis was detected in 15.9\% of ADHD classification studies, lack of independent test set was noted in 13\%, and insufficient methodological detail to establish its presence was noted in another 11.6\%. Accuracy of classification ranged from 60\% to 80\% in the 59.4\% of reviewed studies that met criteria for independence of feature selection, model construction, and test datasets. Moreover, there was a negative relationship between accuracy and sample size, implying additional bias contributing to reported accuracies at lower sample sizes.
Conclusions
High classification accuracies in neuroimaging studies of ADHD appear to be inflated by circular analysis and small sample size. Accuracies on independent datasets were consistent with known heterogeneity of the disorder. Steps to resolve these issues, and a shift toward accounting for sample heterogeneity and prediction of future outcomes, will be crucial in future classification studies in ADHD.},

However, selection among noisy measurements can render circular an otherwise appropriate analysis and invalidate results. Here we argue that systems neuroscience needs to adjust some widespread practices to avoid the circularity that can arise from selection. In particular, 'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem, we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain the experimental effects in question. Spurious effects can appear in the context of both univariate activation analysis and multivariate pattern-information analysis. We suggest a policy for avoiding circularity.},

To empirically evaluate for evidence of excessive significance bias in this literature, we searched for published fMRI studies of human brain to evaluate sex differences, regardless of the topic investigated, in Medline and Scopus over 10 years. We analyzed the prevalence of conclusions in favor of sex differences and the correlation between study sample sizes and number of significant foci identified. In the absence of bias, larger studies (better powered) should identify a larger number of significant foci. Across 179 papers, median sample size was n = 32 (interquartile range 23-47.5). A median of 5 foci related to sex differences were reported (interquartile range, 2-9.5). Few articles (n = 2) had titles focused on no differences or on similarities (n = 3) between sexes. Overall, 158 papers (88\%) reached “positive” conclusions in their abstract and presented some foci related to sex differences. There was no statistically significant relationship between sample size and the number of foci (−0.048\% increase for every 10 participants, p = 0.63). The extremely high prevalence of “positive” results and the lack of the expected relationship between sample size and the number of discovered foci reflect probable reporting bias and excess significance bias in this literature.},

The intrinsic functional connectivity patterns of the brain are reportedly associated with extraversion. However, whether or not extraversion is associated with functional hubs warrants clarification. Functional hubs are involved in the rapid integration of neural processing, and their dysfunction contributes to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we employed the functional connectivity density (FCD) method for the first time to distinguish the energy-efficient hubs associated with extraversion. The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 71 healthy subjects were used in the analysis. Short-range FCD was positively correlated with extraversion in the left cuneus, revealing a link between the local functional activity of this region and extraversion in risk-taking. Long-range FCD was negatively correlated with extraversion in the right superior frontal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses revealed that a decreased long-range FCD in individuals with high extraversion scores showed a low long-range functional connectivity pattern between the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex. This result suggests that decreased RSFC patterns are responsible for self-esteem, self-evaluation, and inhibitory behaviour system that account for the modulation and shaping of extraversion. Overall, our results emphasize specific brain hubs, and reveal long-range functional connections in relation to extraversion, thereby providing a neurobiological basis of extraversion.},

	abstract = {In the context of neuroimaging experiments, it is essential to account for the multiple comparisons problem when thresholding statistical mappings. Various methods are in use to deal with this issue, but they differ in their signal detection power for small- and large-scale effects. In this paper, we comprehensively describe a new method that is based on control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method increases sensitivity by exploiting the spatially clustered nature of neuroimaging effects. This is achieved by using a sliding window technique, in which FDR-control is first applied at a regional level. Thus, a new statistical map that is related to the regionally achieved FDR is derived from the available voxelwise P-values. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, thresholding based on this map is demonstrated to have better discriminatory power than conventional thresholding based on P-values. Secondly, it is shown that the resulting maps can be thresholded at a level that results in control of the global FDR. By means of statistical arguments and numerical simulations under widely varying conditions, our method is validated, characterized, and compared to some other common voxel-based methods (uncorrected thresholding, Bonferroni correction, and conventional FDR-control). It is found that our method shows considerably higher sensitivity as compared to conventional FDR-control, while still controlling the achieved FDR at the same level or better. Finally, our method is applied to two diverse neuroimaging experiments to assess its practical merits, resulting in substantial improvements as compared to the other methods.},

Correct inference using any of these criteria depends crucially on the specification of the null distribution of the test statistics. In this article we show examples from fMRI and DTI data where the theoretical null distribution does not match well the observed distribution of the test statistics. As a solution, we introduce the use of an empirical null, a null distribution empirically estimated from the data itself, allowing for global corrections of theoretical null assumptions. The theoretical null distributions considered are normal, t, χ2 and F, all commonly encountered in neuroimaging. The empirical null estimate is accompanied by an estimate of the proportion of non-active voxels in the data. Based on the two-class mixture model, we present the equivalence between the strategies of controlling FDR and thresholding posterior probabilities in the context of neuroimaging and show that the FDR estimates derived from the empirical null can be seen as empirical Bayes estimates.},

We incorporate fractional anisotrophy, fiber orientation from the 5D Knutsson representation of the principal eigenvectors, and connectivity between the thalamus and the cortical lobes, as features. Combining these multiple information sources allows us to identify discriminating dimensions and thus parcellate the thalamic nuclei. A hierarchical random forest framework with a multidimensional feature per voxel, first distinguishes thalamus from background, and then separates each group of thalamic nuclei. Using a leave one out cross-validation on 12 subjects we have a mean Dice score of 0.805 and 0.799 for the left and right thalami, respectively.

Mapping anatomy from stereotactic atlases to patient data is problematic because of individual differences in subject anatomy that are not accounted for by commonly used atlases. We present a segmentation method for individual subject diffusion tensor MR data that is based on local diffusion information to identify subregions of the thalamus. We show the correspondence of our segmentation results to anatomy by comparison with stereotactic atlas data. Importantly, we verify the consistency of our segmentation by evaluating the method on 63 healthy volunteers. Our method is fast, reliable, and independent of any segmentation before the classification of regions within the thalamus. It should, therefore, be useful in clinical applications.

We determined localization, size and individual variations of 21 thalamic clusters in a group of 63 healthy human subjects (32 males/31 females). The laterality differences accounted for ±6 \% and gender differences for ±4 \% of the thalamic volume. Consecutively, five stable clusters in the anterior, medial, lateral and posterior thalamus were selected, which were common to 90 \% of all subjects and contained at least 10 voxels. These clusters could be assigned to the anteroventral nucleus (AN) group, the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus, the medial pulvinar (PuM), and the lateral nuclei group. The subcortical and cortical connectivity of these clusters revealed that: (1) the oblique cranio-caudal-oriented fibers of the AN cluster mainly connect to limbic structures, (2) the numerous dorso-frontal-oriented fibers of MD mainly project to the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobe, (3) the fibers of the PuM running in parallel with the x-axis project to medio-occipital and medio-temporal areas and connect visual areas with the hippocampus and amygdala and via intrathalamic pathways with medio-frontal areas, and (4) the oblique caudo-cranial fibers of the two lateral clusters located anteriorly in the motor and posteriorly in the sensory thalamus are routing sensory–motor information from the brain stem via the internal capsule to pre- and peri-central regions of the cortex.},

We show that these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported findings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this nonindependent analysis inflates correlations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge authors to perform such reanalyses. The underlying problems described here appear to be common in fMRI research of many kinds—not just in studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition.},

	abstract = {Many studies of brain function with positron emission tomography (PET) involve the interpretation of a subtracted PET image, usually the difference between two images under baseline and stimulation conditions. The purpose of these studies is to see which areas of the brain are activated by the stimulation condition. In many cognitive studies, the activation is so slight that the experiment must be repeated on several subjects and the subtracted images are averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The averaged image is then standardized to have unit variance and then searched for local maxima. The main problem facing investigators is which of these local maxima are statistically significant. We describe a simple method for determining an approximate p value for the global maximum based on the theory of Gaussian random fields. The p value is proportional to the volume searched divided by the product of the full widths at half-maximum of the image reconstruction process or number of resolution elements. Rather than working with local maxima, our method focuses on the Euler characteristic of the set of voxels with a value larger than a given threshold. The Euler characteristic depends only on the topology of the regions of high activation, irrespective of their shape. For large threshold values this is approximately the same as the number of isolated regions of activation above the threshold. We can thus not only determine if any activation has taken place, but we can also estimate how many isolated regions of activation are present.},

	abstract = {Cognitive reserve (CR) prevents cognitive decline and delays neurodegeneration. Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that lifelong bilingualism may act as CR delaying the onset of dementia by ∼4.5 y. Much controversy surrounds the issue of bilingualism and its putative neuroprotective effects. We studied brain metabolism, a direct index of synaptic function and density, and neural connectivity to shed light on the effects of bilingualism in vivo in Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Eighty-five patients with probable AD and matched for disease duration (45 German-Italian bilingual speakers and 40 monolingual speakers) were included. Notably, bilingual individuals were on average 5 y older than their monolingual peers. In agreement with our predictions and with models of CR, cerebral hypometabolism was more severe in the group of bilingual individuals with AD. The metabolic connectivity analyses crucially supported the neuroprotective effect of bilingualism by showing an increased connectivity in the executive control and the default mode networks in the bilingual, compared with the monolingual, AD patients. Furthermore, the degree of lifelong bilingualism (i.e., high, moderate, or low use) was significantly correlated to functional modulations in crucial neural networks, suggesting both neural reserve and compensatory mechanisms. These findings indicate that lifelong bilingualism acts as a powerful CR proxy in dementia and exerts neuroprotective effects against neurodegeneration. Delaying the onset of dementia is a top priority of modern societies, and the present in vivo neurobiological evidence should stimulate social programs and interventions to support bilingual or multilingual education and the maintenance of the second language among senior citizens.},

The aim of the study is to investigate sensorimotor network modifications in PME by assessing the relationship between neurophysiological findings and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation. Somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP) obtained briefly before fMRI and BOLD activation during median-nerve electrical stimulation were recorded in four subjects with typical PME phenotype and compared with normative data. Giant scalp SSEPs with enlarger N20-P25 complex compared to normal data (mean amplitude of 26.2 ± 8.2 μV after right stimulation and 27.9 ± 3.7 μV after left stimulation) were detected. Statistical group analysis showed a reduced BOLD activation in response to median nerve stimulation in PMEs compared to controls over the sensorimotor (SM) areas and an increased response over subcortical regions (p {\textless} 0.01, Z {\textgreater} 2.3, corrected). PMEs show dissociation between neurophysiological and BOLD findings of SSEPs (giant SSEP with reduced BOLD activation over SM). A direct pathway connecting a highly restricted area of the somatosensory cortex with the thalamus can be hypothesized to support the higher excitability of these areas.},

Pairing a stimulus in one modality (vision) with a stimulus in another (sound) can lead to task-induced hallucinations in healthy individuals. After many trials, people eventually report perceiving a nonexistent stimulus contingent on the presence of the previously paired stimulus. Powers et al. investigated how different groups of volunteers and patients respond to this conditioning paradigm. They used behavior, neuroimaging, and computational modeling to dissect the effect of perceptual priors versus sensory evidence on such induced hallucinations. People who are more prone to hear voices were more susceptible to the induced auditory hallucinations. The network of brain regions that was active during the conditioned hallucinations resembled the network observed during clinical symptom capture in individuals who hallucinate while in a brain scanner.
Science, this issue p. 596
Some people hear voices that others do not, but only some of those people seek treatment. Using a Pavlovian learning task, we induced conditioned hallucinations in four groups of people who differed orthogonally in their voice-hearing and treatment-seeking statuses. People who hear voices were significantly more susceptible to the effect. Using functional neuroimaging and computational modeling of perception, we identified processes that differentiated voice-hearers from non–voice-hearers and treatment-seekers from non–treatment-seekers and characterized a brain circuit that mediated the conditioned hallucinations. These data demonstrate the profound and sometimes pathological impact of top-down cognitive processes on perception and may represent an objective means to discern people with a need for treatment from those without.
Perceptual beliefs, stimulus associations, and belief volatility drive task-induced hallucinations in voice-hearers.

	abstract = {Background
Mechanistically based neural markers such as amygdala reactivity offer one approach to addressing the challenges of differentiating bipolar and unipolar depressive disorders, independently from mood state and acute symptoms. Although emotion-elicited amygdala reactivity has been found to distinguish bipolar from unipolar patients in depressed states, it remains unknown whether this distinction is trait-like and present in the absence of an acutely depressed mood. We address this gap by investigating bipolar (BP) and unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) populations in remission.
Methods
73 participants (23 BP and 25 MDD patients matched for age-gender, number of depressive episodes and severity; 25 age-gender matched healthy individuals) completed supra- and subliminal processing of threat, sad, happy and neutral faces during fMRI. We compared groups for activation and connectivity for the amygdala.
Results
BP participants had lower left amygdala activation than MDD during supraliminal and subliminal threat, sad and neutral processing and for subliminal happy faces. BP participants also exhibited lower amygdala connectivity to the insula and hippocampus for threat and to medial orbito-frontal for happy supraliminal and subliminal processing. BP participants also demonstrated greater amygdala-insula connectivity for sad supraliminal and subliminal face processing. Both patient groups were distinct from controls across several measures for activation and connectivity.
Conclusion
Independent of valence or level of emotional awareness amygdala activation and connectivity during facial emotion processing can distinguish BP and MDD patients. These findings provide evidence that this neural substrate could be a potential trait-marker to differentiate these two disorders largely independent of illness state.},

We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

In this chronnectome study, we investigate the replicability of the human brain's inter-regional coupling dynamics during rest by evaluating two different dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis frameworks using 7 500 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. To quantify the extent to which the emergent functional connectivity (FC) patterns are reproducible, we characterize the temporal dynamics by deriving several summary measures across multiple large, independent age-matched samples. Reproducibility was demonstrated through the existence of basic connectivity patterns (FC states) amidst an ensemble of inter-regional connections. Furthermore, application of the methods to conservatively configured (statistically stationary, linear and Gaussian) surrogate datasets revealed that some of the studied state summary measures were indeed statistically significant and also suggested that this class of null model did not explain the fMRI data fully. This extensive testing of reproducibility of similarity statistics also suggests that the estimated FC states are robust against variation in data quality, analysis, grouping, and decomposition methods. We conclude that future investigations probing the functional and neurophysiological relevance of time-varying connectivity assume critical importance.},

	abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

The reason for this is a mistake that generates other seeming paradoxes: the interpretation of the post-trial p-value in the same way as the pre-trial α error.

The most visible argument that SS is not an index of replicability, one that is based in notions of Bayesian statistical inference, is considered and shown to be flawed. Two different arguments are presented that demonstrate the irrelevance of SS to replicability: (a) SS may not be taken as a sign of the truth of the research hypothesis; and (b) statistical significance tests do not generate verifiable predictions of replication attempts. Direct tests of replicability and effect-size measures of replicability are shown to have comparable problems. A solution to the replicability problem is proposed for atheoretical research that replaces `once-and-for-all' tests of replicability with the requirement that the treatment effect be demonstrable (a) in the individual, (b) on a continuing basis, and (c) in a way that is clearly discernible. The question of the role of significance testing in research is answered by denying a role to such testing.},

With this increasing emphasis placed on reproducibility, it is essential that replication studies be capable of advancing the field. However, we argue that many researchers have been only narrowly interpreting the meaning of replication, with studies being designed with a simple statistically significant or nonsignificant results framework in mind. Although this interpretation may be desirable in some cases, we develop a variety of additional “replication goals” that researchers could consider when planning studies. Even if researchers are aware of these goals, we show that they are rarely used in practice—as results are typically analyzed in a manner only appropriate to a simple significance test. We discuss each goal conceptually, explain appropriate analysis procedures, and provide 1 or more examples to illustrate these analyses in practice. We hope that these various goals will allow researchers to develop a more nuanced understanding of replication that can be flexible enough to answer the various questions that researchers might seek to understand.

Despite the careful and nuanced analysis reported, the simple narrative disseminated by the mass, social, and scientific media was that in only 36\% of the studies were the original results replicated. In the current study, however, we showed that 77\% of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95\% prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers’ intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervals—and a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size (or existence) of the true effect. In this light, the results of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology can be viewed as statistically consistent with what one might expect when performing a large-scale replication experiment.},

	abstract = {Whole brain fMRI analyses rarely include the entire brain because of missing data that result from data acquisition limits and susceptibility artifact, in particular. This missing data problem is typically addressed by omitting voxels from analysis, which may exclude brain regions that are of theoretical interest and increase the potential for Type II error at cortical boundaries or Type I error when spatial thresholds are used to establish significance. Imputation could significantly expand statistical map coverage, increase power, and enhance interpretations of fMRI results. We examined multiple imputation for group level analyses of missing fMRI data using methods that leverage the spatial information in fMRI datasets for both real and simulated data. Available case analysis, neighbor replacement, and regression based imputation approaches were compared in a general linear model framework to determine the extent to which these methods quantitatively (effect size) and qualitatively (spatial coverage) increased the sensitivity of group analyses. In both real and simulated data analysis, multiple imputation provided 1) variance that was most similar to estimates for voxels with no missing data, 2) fewer false positive errors in comparison to mean replacement, and 3) fewer false negative errors in comparison to available case analysis. Compared to the standard analysis approach of omitting voxels with missing data, imputation methods increased brain coverage in this study by 35\% (from 33,323 to 45,071 voxels). In addition, multiple imputation increased the size of significant clusters by 58\% and number of significant clusters across statistical thresholds, compared to the standard voxel omission approach. While neighbor replacement produced similar results, we recommend multiple imputation because it uses an informed sampling distribution to deal with missing data across subjects that can include neighbor values and other predictors. Multiple imputation is anticipated to be particularly useful for 1) large fMRI data sets with inconsistent missing voxels across subjects and 2) addressing the problem of increased artifact at ultra-high field, which significantly limit the extent of whole brain coverage and interpretations of results.},

The statistic value itself, as a dimensionless measure, does not provide information on the biophysical interpretation of a study, and it certainly does not represent the whole picture of a study. Unfortunately, in contrast to standard practice in most scientific fields, effect (or amplitude) estimates are usually not provided in most results reporting in the current neuroimaging publications and presentations. Possible reasons underlying this general trend include (1) lack of general awareness, (2) software limitations, (3) inaccurate estimation of the BOLD response, and (4) poor modeling due to our relatively limited understanding of FMRI signal components. However, as we discuss here, such reporting damages the reliability and interpretability of the scientific findings themselves, and there is in fact no overwhelming reason for such a practice to persist. In order to promote meaningful interpretation, cross validation, reproducibility, meta and power analyses in neuroimaging, we strongly suggest that, as part of good scientific practice, effect estimates should be reported together with their corresponding statistic values. We provide several easily adaptable recommendations for facilitating this process.},

A clinically important challenge is to discover cancer subtypes and their molecular drivers in a comprehensive genetic context. Curtis et al. [Nature (2012) 486(7403):346–352] has recently shown that integrative clustering of copy number and gene expression in 2,000 breast tumors reveals novel subgroups beyond the classic expression subtypes that show distinct clinical outcomes. To extend the scope of integrative analysis for the inclusion of somatic mutation data by massively parallel sequencing, we propose a framework for joint modeling of discrete and continuous variables that arise from integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling. The core idea is motivated by the hypothesis that diverse molecular phenotypes can be predicted by a set of orthogonal latent variables that represent distinct molecular drivers, and thus can reveal tumor subgroups of biological and clinical importance. Using the cancer cell line encyclopedia dataset, we demonstrate our method can accurately group cell lines by their cell-of-origin for several cancer types, and precisely pinpoint their known and potential cancer driver genes. Our integrative analysis also demonstrates the power for revealing subgroups that are not lineage-dependent, but consist of different cancer types driven by a common genetic alteration. Application of the cancer genome atlas colorectal cancer data reveals distinct integrated tumor subtypes, suggesting different genetic pathways in colon cancer progression.},

In this study, we use penalized latent variable regression methods for joint modeling of multiple omics data types to identify common latent variables that can be used to cluster patient samples into biologically and clinically relevant disease subtypes. We consider lasso [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 58 (1996) 267–288], elastic net [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 67 (2005) 301–320] and fused lasso [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 67 (2005) 91–108] methods to induce sparsity in the coefficient vectors, revealing important genomic features that have significant contributions to the latent variables. An iterative ridge regression is used to compute the sparse coefficient vectors. In model selection, a uniform design [Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability (1994) Chapman \& Hall] is used to seek “experimental” points that scattered uniformly across the search domain for efficient sampling of tuning parameter combinations. We compared our method to sparse singular value decomposition (SVD) and penalized Gaussian mixture model (GMM) using both real and simulated data sets.

Spatial transcriptomics can link molecularly described cell types to their anatomical positions and functional roles. Moffitt et al. used a combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing and MERFISH (multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization) to map the identity and location of specific cell types within the mouse preoptic hypothalamus and surrounding areas of the brain (see the Perspective by Tasic and Nicovich). They related these cell types to specific behaviors via gene activity. The approach provides an unbiased description of cell types of the preoptic area, which are important for sleep, thermoregulation, thirst, and social behavior.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONA mechanistic understanding of brain function requires the identification of distinct cell types in the brain at a molecular, spatial, and functional level. The preoptic region of the hypothalamus comprises multiple nuclei and controls many social behaviors and homeostatic functions. Discrete neuronal types within the preoptic region have been associated with specific hypothalamic behaviors and homeostatic controls, yet the organizational principles of the underlying circuits remain elusive. Further progress requires methods that can identify molecularly distinct cell types and map their spatial and functional organization in the tissue.
RATIONALESingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the understanding of many tissues by allowing a systematic, genome-wide molecular identification of cell types. However, scRNA-seq requires cell dissociation, leading to a loss of spatial context that is essential to understand the cellular architecture of brain circuits. Image-based approaches to single-cell transcriptomics enables gene expression profiling of individual cells within their native tissue and offers opportunities for simultaneous in situ cell-type identification and spatial mapping, as well as functional characterization when combined with activity marker imaging. The combination of these complementary techniques would allow us to generate a molecular inventory of neuronal types while mapping their spatial and functional organization.
RESULTSWe combined scRNA-seq and multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-cell transcriptome imaging method, to investigate the molecular, spatial, and functional organization of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. We profiled {\textasciitilde}31,000 cells using scRNA-seq and imaged {\textasciitilde}1.1 million cells within intact tissues using MERFISH. Our data revealed a remarkable diversity of neurons in this region, comprising {\textasciitilde}70 different neuronal populations, many of which were previously unknown. These neuronal types exhibited distinct neuromodulatory signatures and revealed a striking heterogeneity within cell populations that were previously thought to be functionally unitary. MERFISH measurements further allowed us to map the spatial organization of these neuronal types, determine the cellular composition of distinct nuclei, and provide insights into the functional organization of neuron populations, including topographical relationships that underlie sex hormone signaling.Last, we combined MERFISH with immediate-early-gene expression imaging to identify specific neuronal populations activated by social behaviors, including parenting, mating, and aggression. Several neuronal populations were selectively activated in each of these behaviors, supporting the notion that transcriptionally distinct neuronal types control specific hypothalamic functions. We identified a core neuronal population activated in all animals that exhibit parenting, as well as cell populations differentially activated in mothers and fathers, providing insights into how physiological state may affect parental behavior. Moreover, we identified cells associated with sexual behavior in males and females as well as male aggression toward infants and conspecific males.
CONCLUSIONBy combining MERFISH with scRNA-seq, we have revealed the molecular, spatial, and functional organization of neurons within the hypothalamic preoptic region. These results provide a framework for mechanistic investigation of behavior circuits with high molecular and spatial resolution and opens avenues for identifying and mapping cell types in a diverse range of tissues and organisms. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6416/eaau5324/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint In situ single-cell profiling reveals the molecular and cellular organization of the hypothalamic preoptic region.The combination of MERFISH with scRNA-seq to profile the gene expression of 1 million cells in situ revealed {\textasciitilde}70 neuronal populations in the preoptic region, each with distinct molecular signatures and spatial organizations, providing insights into neuromodulatory signaling pathways. Further combination with activity marker imaging led to the identification of discrete neuronal types activated by key social behaviors, including parenting, aggression, and mating.
The hypothalamus controls essential social behaviors and homeostatic functions. However, the cellular architecture of hypothalamic nuclei—including the molecular identity, spatial organization, and function of distinct cell types—is poorly understood. Here, we developed an imaging-based in situ cell-type identification and mapping method and combined it with single-cell RNA-sequencing to create a molecularly annotated and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. We profiled {\textasciitilde}1 million cells, identified {\textasciitilde}70 neuronal populations characterized by distinct neuromodulatory signatures and spatial organizations, and defined specific neuronal populations activated during social behaviors in male and female mice, providing a high-resolution framework for mechanistic investigation of behavior circuits. The approach described opens a new avenue for the construction of cell atlases in diverse tissues and organisms.
A spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic study of an essential brain region yields a functionally annotated cell atlas.

Existing scRNA-seq analysis methods incorrectly assume that the composition of cell populations is either known or identical across batches. We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.},

Defining cell types requires integrating diverse single-cell measurements from multiple experiments and biological contexts. To flexibly model single-cell datasets, we developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity. We applied it to four diverse and challenging analyses of human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined region-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Second, we analyzed expression in the human substantia nigra, comparing cell states in specific donors and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we integrated in situ and single-cell expression data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we jointly defined mouse cortical cell types using single-cell RNA-seq and DNA methylation profiles, revealing putative mechanisms of cell-type-specific epigenomic regulation. Integrative analyses using LIGER promise to accelerate investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.},

	abstract = {The brain is the body's largest energy consumer, even in the absence of demanding tasks. Electrophysiologists report on-going neuronal firing during stimulation or task in regions beyond those of primary relationship to the perturbation. Although the biological origin of consciousness remains elusive, it is argued that it emerges from complex, continuous whole-brain neuronal collaboration. Despite converging evidence suggesting the whole brain is continuously working and adapting to anticipate and actuate in response to the environment, over the last 20 y, task-based functional MRI (fMRI) have emphasized a localizationist view of brain function, with fMRI showing only a handful of activated regions in response to task/stimulation. Here, we challenge that view with evidence that under optimal noise conditions, fMRI activations extend well beyond areas of primary relationship to the task; and blood-oxygen level-dependent signal changes correlated with task-timing appear in over 95\% of the brain for a simple visual stimulation plus attention control task. Moreover, we show that response shape varies substantially across regions, and that whole-brain parcellations based on those differences produce distributed clusters that are anatomically and functionally meaningful, symmetrical across hemispheres, and reproducible across subjects. These findings highlight the exquisite detail lying in fMRI signals beyond what is normally examined, and emphasize both the pervasiveness of false negatives, and how the sparseness of fMRI maps is not a result of localized brain function, but a consequence of high noise and overly strict predictive response models.},

	abstract = {The mass-univariate approach for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis remains a widely used statistical tool within neuroimaging. However, this method suffers from at least two fundamental limitations: First, with sufficient sample sizes there is high enough statistical power to reject the null hypothesis everywhere, making it difficult if not impossible to localize effects of interest. Second, with any sample size, when cluster-size inference is used a significant p-value only indicates that a cluster is larger than chance. Therefore, no notion of confidence is available to express the size or location of a cluster that could be expected with repeated sampling from the population. In this work, we address these issues by extending on a method proposed by Sommerfeld et al. (2018) (SSS) to develop spatial Confidence Sets (CSs) on clusters found in thresholded raw effect size maps. While hypothesis testing indicates where the null, i.e. a raw effect size of zero, can be rejected, the CSs give statements on the locations where raw effect sizes exceed, and fall short of, a non-zero threshold, providing both an upper and lower CS. While the method can be applied to any mass-univariate General Linear Model, we motivate the method in the context of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI contrast maps for inference on percentage BOLD change raw effects. We propose several theoretical and practical implementation advancements to the original method formulated in SSS, delivering a procedure with superior performance in sample sizes as low as N=60. We validate the method with 3D Monte Carlo simulations that resemble fMRI data. Finally, we compute CSs for the Human Connectome Project working memory task contrast images, illustrating the brain regions that show a reliable \%BOLD change for a given \%BOLD threshold.},

	abstract = {Background
There is considerable evidence that the thalamus is abnormal in psychotic disorders. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed an intriguing pattern of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis characterized by reduced prefrontal cortex (PFC) connectivity and increased somatomotor-thalamic connectivity. However, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the onset, anatomical specificity, and clinical correlates of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis.
Methods
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected on 105 healthy subjects and 148 individuals with psychosis, including 53 early-stage psychosis patients. Using all 253 subjects, the thalamus was parceled into functional regions of interest (ROIs) on the basis of connectivity with six a priori defined cortical ROIs covering most of the cortical mantle. Functional connectivity between each cortical ROI and its corresponding thalamic ROI was quantified and compared across groups. Significant differences in the ROI-to-ROI analysis were followed up with voxelwise seed-based analyses to further localize thalamic dysconnectivity.
Results
ROI analysis revealed reduced PFC-thalamic connectivity and increased somatomotor-thalamic connectivity in both chronic and early-stage psychosis patients. PFC hypoconnectivity and motor cortex hyperconnectivity correlated in patients, suggesting that they result from a common pathophysiological mechanism. Seed-based analyses revealed thalamic hypoconnectivity in psychosis localized to dorsolateral PFC, medial PFC, and cerebellar areas of the well-described executive control network. Across all subjects, thalamic connectivity with areas of the fronto-parietal network correlated with cognitive functioning, including verbal learning and memory.
Conclusions
Thalamocortical dysconnectivity is present in both chronic and early stages of psychosis, includes reduced thalamic connectivity with the executive control network, and is related to cognitive impairment.},

The methods we present reveal how the odds pertaining to a given dichotomized variable (e.g., the odds that a soldier would prefer a Northern to a Southern Camp assignment) are related to other dichotomized variables (e.g., (a) the soldier's race, (b) his region of origin, (c) his present camp location). The usual regression analysis methods do not suit the case considered here, where the dependent variable is the odds pertaining to a given dichotomous variable. Nor do the usual methods suit the case where the dependent variable is a proportion pertaining to the dichotomous variable. This article presents some relatively elementary models and methods suitable for analyzing the odds (or a proportion) pertaining to the given dichotomous dependent variable. Applying these models and methods to the data referred to above, new insights are obtained.},

We propose an alternative, nonparametric MSM (NPMSM) approach that extends the definition of causal parameters of interest and causal effects. This approach is appealing in practice as it does not require correct specification of a parametric model but instead relies on a working model which can be willingly misspecified. We propose a methodology for longitudinal data to generate and estimate so-called NPMSM parameters describing so-called nonparametric causal effects and provide insight on how to interpret these parameters causally in practice. Results are illustrated with a point treatment simulation study. The proposed NPMSM approach to Causal Inference is compared to the more typical PMSM approach and we contribute to the general understanding of PMSM estimation by addressing the issue of PMSM misspecification.},

One relatively uncommon, but very informative, standardized measure of effect size is Cohen’s f2, which allows an evaluation of local effect size, i.e., one variable’s effect size within the context of a multivariate regression model. Unfortunately, this measure is often not readily accessible from commonly used software for repeated-measures or hierarchical data analysis. In this guide, we illustrate how to extract Cohen’s f2 for two variables within a mixed-effects regression model using PROC MIXED in SAS® software. Two examples of calculating Cohen’s f2 for different research questions are shown, using data from a longitudinal cohort study of smoking development in adolescents. This tutorial is designed to facilitate the calculation and reporting of effect sizes for single variables within mixed-effects multiple regression models, and is relevant for analyses of repeated-measures or hierarchical/multilevel data that are common in experimental psychology, observational research, and clinical or intervention studies.},

The ordinary least squares estimator of the vector of regression parameters remains unbiased, consistent and asymptotically normal under unequal error variances.

The usual practice is to couple it with an asymptotically valid estimation of its covariance matrix, and then carry out hypothesis tests that are valid under heteroskedasticity of unknown form. We use numerical integration methods to compute the exact null distributions of some quasi-t test statistics, and propose a new covariance matrix estimator.

In the present work, we take on various critiques of our work and further explore the limitations of our original work. We address issues about the particular event-related designs we used, considering multiple event types and randomization of events between subjects. We consider the lack of validity found with one-sample permutation (sign flipping) tests, investigating a number of approaches to improve the false positive control of this widely used procedure. We found that the combination of a two-sided test and cleaning the data using ICA FIX resulted in nominal false positive rates for all data sets, meaning that data cleaning is not only important for resting state fMRI, but also for task fMRI. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work on the fMRI literature as a whole, estimating that at least 10\% of the fMRI studies have used the most problematic cluster inference method (p = .01 cluster defining threshold), and how individual studies can be interpreted in light of our findings. These additional results underscore our original conclusions, on the importance of data sharing and thorough evaluation of statistical methods on realistic null data.},

The book is aimed a a graduate level audience who has some exposure to the methods of theoretical statistics. However, technical details are delayed until the last chapter (entitled "Details of Mathematical Rogour"), and so a mathematically able reader without knowledge of the rigorous theory of probability will have no trouble understanding the first four-fifths of the book.

The simulation results in the literature suggest that some of these methods work quite well in practice; the theoretical results are limited and more mixed in their conclusions. For example, McCullagh reached negative conclusions about the use of non-parametric bootstraps for one-way arrays. The purpose of this paper is to extend our understanding of the issues by discussing the effect of different ways of modelling clustered data, the criteria for successful bootstraps used in the literature and extending the theory from functions of the sample mean to include functions of the between and within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps to include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the consistency of variance estimates for a bootstrap method depends on the choice of model with the residual bootstrap giving consistency under the transformation model whereas the cluster bootstrap gives consistent estimates under both the transformation and the random-effect model. In addition we note that the criteria based on the distribution of the bootstrap observations are not really useful in assessing consistency.},

	abstract = {In this article, we consider bootstrapping the Lasso estimator of the regression parameter in a multiple linear regression model. It is known that the standard bootstrap method fails to be consistent. Here, we propose a modified bootstrap method, and show that it provides valid approximation to the distribution of the Lasso estimator, for all possible values of the unknown regression parameter vector, including the case where some of the components are zero. Further, we establish consistency of the modified bootstrap method for estimating the asymptotic bias and variance of the Lasso estimator. We also show that the residual bootstrap can be used to consistently estimate the distribution and variance of the adaptive Lasso estimator. Using the former result, we formulate a novel data-based method for choosing the optimal penalizing parameter for the Lasso using the modified bootstrap. A numerical study is performed to investigate the finite sample performance of the modified bootstrap. The methodology proposed in the article is illustrated with a real data example.},

At each boosting iteration, a new training set is created using weighted random sampling from the original dataset and a simple clustering algorithm (e.g. k-means) is applied to provide a new data partitioning. The final clustering solution is produced by aggregating the multiple clustering results through weighted voting. Experiments on both artificial and real-world data sets indicate that boost-clustering provides solutions of improved quality.},

This article explains how effect sizes have misdirected practice in education and other disciplines. Even when effect size is incorporated into RCT research the recommendations of whether interventions are effective are misleading and generally useless to practitioners. As a result, a new criterion of practical benefit is recommended for evaluating research findings about the effectiveness of interventions in complex organizations where benchmarks of existing performance exist. Practical benefit exists when the unadjusted performance of an experimental group provides a noticeable advantage over an existing benchmark. Some basic principles for determining practical benefit are provided. Practical benefit is more intuitive and is expected to enable leaders to make more accurate assessments as to whether published research findings are likely to produce noticeable improvements in their organizations. In addition, practical benefit is used routinely as the research criterion for the alternative scientific methodology of improvement science that has an established track record of being a more efficient way to develop new interventions that improve practice dramatically than RCT research. Finally, the problems with practical significance suggest that the research community should seek different inferential methods for research designed to improve clinical performance in complex organizations, as compared to methods for testing theories and medicines.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for in vivo detection and characterization of white matter lesions (WML) in multiple sclerosis (MS). The most widely established MRI outcome measure is the volume of hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images (T2L). Unfortunately, T2L are non-specific for the level of tissue destruction and show a weak relationship to clinical status. Interest in lesions appearing hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1L) (“black holes”), which provide more specificity for axonal loss and a closer link to neurologic disability, has thus grown. The technical difficulty of T1L segmentation has led investigators to rely on time-consuming manual assessments prone to inter- and intra-rater variability. We implement MIMoSA, a current T2L automatic segmentation approach, to delineate T1L. Using cross-validation, MIMoSA proved robust for segmenting both T2L and T1L. For T2L, a Sørensen-Dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.6 and partial AUC (pAUC) up to 1\% false positive rate of 0.69 were achieved. For T1L, 0.48 DSC and 0.63 pAUC were achieved. The correlation between EDSS and manual versus automatic volumes were similar for T1L (0.32 manual vs. 0.34 MIMoSA) and T2L (0.34 vs. 0.34).},

For a least squares regression analysis using either of these two missing-data approaches, the exact biases of the estimators for the regression coefficients and the residual variance are derived and reported. The complete-case analysis, in which individuals with any missing data are omitted, is also investigated theoretically and is found to be free of bias in many situations, though often wasteful of information. A numerical evaluation of the bias of two missing-indicator methods and the complete-case analysis is reported. The missing-indicator methods show unacceptably large biases in practical situations and are not advisable in general.},

This concept is often used for measurement of model complexity, for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the error variance, and for comparison of different models. I have developed a concept of generalized degrees of freedom (GDF) that is applicable to complex modeling procedures. The definition is based on the sum of the sensitivity of each fitted value to perturbation in the corresponding observed value. The concept is nonasymptotic in nature and does not require analytic knowledge of the modeling procedures. The concept of GDF offers a unified framework under which complex and highly irregular modeling procedures can be analyzed in the same way as classical linear models. By using this framework, many difficult problems can be solved easily. For example, one can now measure the number of observations used in a variable selection process. Different modeling procedures, such as a tree-based regression and a projection pursuit regression, can be compared on the basis of their residual sums of squares and the GDF that they cost. I apply the proposed framework to measure the effect of variable selection in linear models, leading to corrections of selection bias in various goodness-of-fit statistics. The theory also has interesting implications for the effect of general model searching by a human modeler.]},

INTRODUCTIONThe brain is responsible for cognition, behavior, and much of what makes us uniquely human. The development of the brain is a highly complex process, and this process is reliant on precise regulation of molecular and cellular events grounded in the spatiotemporal regulation of the transcriptome. Disruption of this regulation can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders.
RATIONALEThe regulatory, epigenomic, and transcriptomic features of the human brain have not been comprehensively compiled across time, regions, or cell types. Understanding the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders requires knowledge not just of endpoint differences between healthy and diseased brains but also of the developmental and cellular contexts in which these differences arise. Moreover, an emerging body of research indicates that many aspects of the development and physiology of the human brain are not well recapitulated in model organisms, and therefore it is necessary that neuropsychiatric disorders be understood in the broader context of the developing and adult human brain.
RESULTSHere we describe the generation and analysis of a variety of genomic data modalities at the tissue and single-cell levels, including transcriptome, DNA methylation, and histone modifications across multiple brain regions ranging in age from embryonic development through adulthood. We observed a widespread transcriptomic transition beginning during late fetal development and consisting of sharply decreased regional differences. This reduction coincided with increases in the transcriptional signatures of mature neurons and the expression of genes associated with dendrite development, synapse development, and neuronal activity, all of which were temporally synchronous across neocortical areas, as well as myelination and oligodendrocytes, which were asynchronous. Moreover, genes including MEF2C, SATB2, and TCF4, with genetic associations to multiple brain-related traits and disorders, converged in a small number of modules exhibiting spatial or spatiotemporal specificity.
CONCLUSIONWe generated and applied our dataset to document transcriptomic and epigenetic changes across human development and then related those changes to major neuropsychiatric disorders. These data allowed us to identify genes, cell types, gene coexpression modules, and spatiotemporal loci where disease risk might converge, demonstrating the utility of the dataset and providing new insights into human development and disease. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6420/eaat7615/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain development and neuropsychiatric risks.Human brain development begins during embryonic development and continues through adulthood (top).

We related the variation in gene expression (brown, high; purple, low) to regulatory elements in the fetal and adult brains, cell type–specific signatures, and genetic loci associated with neuropsychiatric disorders (bottom right; gray circles indicate enrichment for corresponding features among module genes).

To broaden our understanding of human neurodevelopment, we profiled transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes across brain regions and/or cell types for the entire span of prenatal and postnatal development. Integrative analysis revealed temporal, regional, sex, and cell type–specific dynamics. We observed a global transcriptomic cup-shaped pattern, characterized by a late fetal transition associated with sharply decreased regional differences and changes in cellular composition and maturation, followed by a reversal in childhood-adolescence, and accompanied by epigenomic reorganizations. Analysis of gene coexpression modules revealed relationships with epigenomic regulation and neurodevelopmental processes. Genes with genetic associations to brain-based traits and neuropsychiatric disorders (including MEF2C, SATB2, SOX5, TCF4, and TSHZ3) converged in a small number of modules and distinct cell types, revealing insights into neurodevelopment and the genomic basis of neuropsychiatric risks.},

However, each of these methods presents unique limitations. To generate a more confident and comprehensive view of the complex genetics underlying aggression, we undertook an integrated, cross-species approach. We focused on human and rodent models to derive eight gene lists from three main categories of genetic evidence: two sets of genes identified in GWAS studies, four sets implicated by transcriptome-wide studies of rodent models, and two sets of genes with causal evidence from online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM) and knockout (KO) mice reports. These gene sets were evaluated for overlap and pathway enrichment to extract their similarities and differences. We identified enriched common pathways such as the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, axon guidance, reelin signaling in neurons, and ERK/MAPK signaling. Also, individual genes were ranked based on their cumulative weights to quantify their importance as risk factors for aggressive behavior, which resulted in 40 top-ranked and highly interconnected genes.

	abstract = {Shifts in brain regions with brain size
Brain size among normal humans varies as much as twofold. Reardon et al. surveyed the cortical and subcortical structure of more than 3000 human brains by noninvasive imaging (see the Perspective by Van Essen). They found that the scaling of different regions across the range of brain sizes is not consistent: Some brain regions are metabolically costly and are favored in larger brains. This shifts the balance between associative and sensorimotor brain systems in a brain size–dependent way.
Science, this issue p. 1222; see also p. 1184
Brain size variation over primate evolution and human development is associated with shifts in the proportions of different brain regions. Individual brain size can vary almost twofold among typically developing humans, but the consequences of this for brain organization remain poorly understood. Using in vivo neuroimaging data from more than 3000 individuals, we find that larger human brains show greater areal expansion in distributed frontoparietal cortical networks and related subcortical regions than in limbic, sensory, and motor systems. This areal redistribution recapitulates cortical remodeling across evolution, manifests by early childhood in humans, and is linked to multiple markers of heightened metabolic cost and neuronal connectivity. Thus, human brain shape is systematically coupled to naturally occurring variations in brain size through a scaling map that integrates spatiotemporally diverse aspects of neurobiology.
A metabolically expensive brain network is preferentially expanded in individuals that have larger brains.

	abstract = {Such is the grip of formal methods of statistical inference—that is, frequentist methods for generalizing from sample to population in enumerative studies—in the drawing of scientific inferences that the two are routinely deemed equivalent in the social, management, and biomedical sciences. This, despite the fact that legitimate employment of said methods is difficult to implement on practical grounds alone. But supposing the adoption of these procedures were simple does not get us far; crucially, methods of formal statistical inference are ill-suited to the analysis of much scientific data. Even findings from the claimed gold standard for examination by the latter, randomized controlled trials, can be problematic.Scientific inference is a far broader concept than statistical inference. Its authority derives from the accumulation, over an extensive period of time, of both theoretical and empirical knowledge that has won the (provisional) acceptance of the scholarly community. A major focus of scientific inference can be viewed as the pursuit of significant sameness, meaning replicable and empirically generalizable results among phenomena. Regrettably, the obsession with users of statistical inference to report significant differences in data sets actively thwarts cumulative knowledge development.The manifold problems surrounding the implementation and usefulness of formal methods of statistical inference in advancing science do not speak well of much teaching in methods/statistics classes. Serious reflection on statistics' role in producing viable knowledge is needed. Commendably, the American Statistical Association is committed to addressing this challenge, as further witnessed in this special online, open access issue of The American Statistician.},

Estimating such regions so that the probability for exceeding the level in the entire set is equal to some predefined value is a difficult problem connected to the problem of multiple significance testing. In this work, a method for solving this problem, as well as the related problem of finding credible regions for contour curves, for latent Gaussian models is proposed. The method is based on using a parametric family for the excursion sets in combination with a sequential importance sampling method for estimating joint probabilities. The accuracy of the method is investigated by using simulated data and an environmental application is presented.},

Today, no standardized computational tools exist for the analysis of LNI data and widely used methods are sub-optimal for the types of data encountered in real-life studies. Linear Mixed Effects (LME) modeling, a mature approach well known in the statistics community, offers a powerful and versatile framework for analyzing real-life LNI data. This article presents the theory behind LME models, contrasts it with other popular approaches in the context of LNI, and is accompanied with an array of computational tools that will be made freely available through FreeSurfer — a popular Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) analysis software package. Our core contribution is to provide a quantitative empirical evaluation of the performance of LME and competing alternatives popularly used in prior longitudinal structural MRI studies, namely repeated measures ANOVA and the analysis of annualized longitudinal change measures (e.g. atrophy rate). In our experiments, we analyzed MRI-derived longitudinal hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness measurements from a public dataset consisting of Alzheimer's patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. Our results suggest that the LME approach offers superior statistical power in detecting longitudinal group differences.},

	abstract = {This article proposes the image intraclass correlation (I2C2) coefficient as a global measure of reliability for imaging studies. The I2C2 generalizes the classic intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficient to the case when the data of interest are images, thereby providing a measure that is both intuitive and convenient. Drawing a connection with classical measurement error models for replication experiments, the I2C2 can be computed quickly, even in high-dimensional imaging studies. A nonparametric bootstrap procedure is introduced to quantify the variability of the I2C2 estimator. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo permutation is utilized to test reproducibility versus a zero I2C2, representing complete lack of reproducibility. Methodologies are applied to three replication studies arising from different brain imaging modalities and settings: regional analysis of volumes in normalized space imaging for characterizing brain morphology, seed-voxel brain activation maps based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and fractional anisotropy in an area surrounding the corpus callosum via diffusion tensor imaging. Notably, resting-state fMRI brain activation maps are found to have low reliability, ranging from .2 to .4. Software and data are available to provide easy access to the proposed methods.},

Current statistical methods tend to localize fROIs inconsistently, focusing on avoiding detection of false activation. Not missing true activation is however equally important in this context. In this study, we explored the potential of an alternative-based thresholding (ABT) procedure, where evidence against the null hypothesis of no effect and evidence against a prespecified alternative hypothesis is measured to control both false positives and false negatives directly. The procedure was validated in the context of localizer tasks on simulated brain images and using a real data set of 100 runs per subject. Voxels categorized as active with ABT can be confidently included in the definition of the fROI, while inactive voxels can be confidently excluded. Additionally, the ABT method complements classic null hypothesis significance testing with valuable information by making a distinction between voxels that show evidence against both the null and alternative and voxels for which the alternative hypothesis cannot be rejected despite lack of evidence against the null.},

For example, the traditionally defined partial Spearman's correlation does not have a sensible population parameter, and the conditional Spearman's correlation defined with copulas cannot be easily generalized to discrete variables. We define population parameters for both partial and conditional Spearman's correlation through concordance–discordance probabilities. The definitions are natural extensions of Spearman's rank correlation in the presence of covariates and are general for any orderable random variables. We show that they can be neatly expressed using probability-scale residuals (PSRs). This connection allows us to derive simple estimators. Our partial estimator for Spearman's correlation between X and Y adjusted for Z is the correlation of PSRs from models of X on Z and of Y on Z, which is analogous to the partial Pearson's correlation derived as the correlation of observed-minus-expected residuals. Our conditional estimator is the conditional correlation of PSRs. We describe estimation and inference, and highlight the use of semiparametric cumulative probability models, which allow preservation of the rank-based nature of Spearman's correlation. We conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of our estimators and compare them with other popular measures of association, demonstrating their robustness and efficiency. We illustrate our method in two applications, a biomarker study and a large survey.},

	abstract = {We derive a Gaussian approximation result for the maximum of a sum of high-dimensional random vectors. Specifically, we establish conditions under which the distribution of the maximum is approximated by that of the maximum of a sum of the Gaussian random vectors with the same covariance matrices as the original vectors. This result applies when the dimension of random vectors (ppp) is large compared to the sample size (nnn); in fact, ppp can be much larger than nnn, without restricting correlations of the coordinates of these vectors. We also show that the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the random vectors with unknown covariance matrices can be consistently estimated by the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the conditional Gaussian random vectors obtained by multiplying the original vectors with i.i.d. Gaussian multipliers. This is the Gaussian multiplier (or wild) bootstrap procedure. Here too, ppp can be large or even much larger than nnn. These distributional approximations, either Gaussian or conditional Gaussian, yield a high-quality approximation to the distribution of the original maximum, often with approximation error decreasing polynomially in the sample size, and hence are of interest in many applications. We demonstrate how our Gaussian approximations and the multiplier bootstrap can be used for modern high-dimensional estimation, multiple hypothesis testing, and adaptive specification testing. All these results contain nonasymptotic bounds on approximation errors.},

	abstract = {Under weak and reasonable assumptions, mainly that data are exchangeable under the null hypothesis, permutation tests can provide exact control of false positives and allow the use of various non-standard statistics. There are, however, various common examples in which global exchangeability can be violated, including paired tests, tests that involve repeated measurements, tests in which subjects are relatives (members of pedigrees) — any dataset with known dependence among observations. In these cases, some permutations, if performed, would create data that would not possess the original dependence structure, and thus, should not be used to construct the reference (null) distribution. To allow permutation inference in such cases, we test the null hypothesis using only a subset of all otherwise possible permutations, i.e., using only the rearrangements of the data that respect exchangeability, thus retaining the original joint distribution unaltered. In a previous study, we defined exchangeability for blocks of data, as opposed to each datum individually, then allowing permutations to happen within block, or the blocks as a whole to be permuted. Here we extend that notion to allow blocks to be nested, in a hierarchical, multi-level definition. We do not explicitly model the degree of dependence between observations, only the lack of independence; the dependence is implicitly accounted for by the hierarchy and by the permutation scheme. The strategy is compatible with heteroscedasticity and variance groups, and can be used with permutations, sign flippings, or both combined. We evaluate the method for various dependence structures, apply it to real data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) as an example application, show that false positives can be avoided in such cases, and provide a software implementation of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {When a likelihood ratio is used to measure the strength of evidence for one hypothesis over another, its reliability (i.e. how often it produces misleading evidence) depends on the specification of the working model. When the working model happens to be the ‘true’ or ‘correct’ model, the probability of observing strong misleading evidence is low and controllable. But this is not necessarily the case when the working model is misspecified. Royall and Tsou (J. R. Stat. Soc., Ser. B 2003; 65:391–404) show how to adjust working models to make them robust to misspecification. Likelihood ratios derived from their ‘robust adjusted likelihood’ are just as reliable (asymptotically) as if the working model were correctly specified in the first place. In this paper, we apply and extend these ideas to the generalized linear model (GLM) regression setting. We provide several illustrations (both from simulated data and real data concerning rates of parasitic infection in Philippine adolescents), show how the required adjustment factor can be obtained from standard statistical software, and draw some connections between this approach and the ‘sandwich estimator’ for robust standard errors of regression parameters. This substantially broadens the availability and the viability of likelihood methods for measuring statistical evidence in regression settings. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Summary. The strength of statistical evidence is measured by the likelihood ratio. Two key performance properties of this measure are the probability of observing strong misleading evidence and the probability of observing weak evidence. For the likelihood function associated with a parametric statistical model, these probabilities have a simple large sample structure when the model is correct. Here we examine how that structure changes when the model fails. This leads to criteria for determining whether a given likelihood function is robust (continuing to perform satisfactorily when the model fails), and to a simple technique for adjusting both likelihoods and profile likelihoods to make them robust. We prove that the expected information in the robust adjusted likelihood cannot exceed the expected information in the likelihood function from a true model. We note that the robust adjusted likelihood is asymptotically fully efficient when the working model is correct, and we show that in some important examples this efficiency is retained even when the working model fails. In such cases the Bayes posterior probability distribution based on the adjusted likelihood is robust, remaining correct asymptotically even when the model for the observable random variable does not include the true distribution. Finally we note a link to standard frequentist methodology?in large samples the adjusted likelihood functions provide robust likelihood-based confidence intervals.},

	abstract = {The human cortex is highly folded to allow for a massive expansion of surface area. Notably, the thickness of the cortex strongly depends on cortical topology, with gyral cortex sometimes twice as thick as sulcal cortex. We recently demonstrated that global differences in thickness between gyral and sulcal cortex continue to evolve throughout adolescence. However, human cortical development is spatially heterogeneous, and global comparisons lack power to detect localized differences in development or psychopathology. Here we extend previous work by proposing a new measure – local cortical coupling – that is sensitive to differences in the localized topological relationship between cortical thickness and sulcal depth. After estimation, subject-level coupling maps can be analyzed using standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Capitalizing on a large cross-sectional sample (n=932) of youth imaged as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we demonstrate that local coupling is spatially heterogeneous and exhibits nonlinear development-related trajectories. Moreover, we uncover sex differences in coupling that indicate divergent patterns of cortical topology. Developmental changes and sex differences in coupling support its potential as a neuroimaging phenotype for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders that are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. R code to estimate subject-level coupling maps from any two cortical surfaces generated by FreeSurfer is made publicly available along with this manuscript.},

In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis.

The observation points are assigned to the data space to observe the clusters through the distributions of the distances between the observation points and the objects in the dataset. A Gamma Mixture Model (GMM) is built from a distance distribution to partition the dataset into subsets, and a GMM tree is obtained by recursively partitioning the dataset. From the leaves of the GMM tree, a set of initial cluster centers are identified and the true number of clusters is estimated. This method is implemented in the new GMM-Tree algorithm. Two GMM forest algorithms are further proposed to ensemble multiple GMM trees to handle high dimensional data with many clusters. The GMM-P-Forest algorithm builds GMM trees in parallel, whereas the GMM-S-Forest algorithm uses a sequential process to build a GMM forest. Experiments were conducted on 32 synthetic datasets and 15 real datasets to evaluate the performance of the new algorithms. The results have shown that the proposed algorithms outperformed the existing popular methods: Silhouette, Elbow and Gap Statistic, and the recent method I-nice in estimating the true number of clusters from high dimensional complex data.},

This often requires compilation of results from multiple samples. Quantitative integration of information between samples is complicated by variations in staining intensity and background fluorescence due to differences in fixation and staining between samples, and other technical artefacts that obscure biological variations. Failure to remove these unwanted artefacts will complicate downstream analysis and diminish the value of multiplexed imaging for clinical applications. Here, we describe a \textbf{R}obust int\textbf{E}n\textbf{S}i\textbf{T}y n\textbf{OR}malization m\textbf{E}thod (\textbf{RESTORE}) to compensate for unwanted variations in multiplexed imaging. To do this, first, we automatically identify negative control cells for each marker within the same tissue and then use their expression levels to infer background signal level. Second, the intensity profile is normalized by the inferred background level of the negative control cells to remove between-sample variation. We evaluated the performance with theoretical simulations and tested the method using two different datasets; one comprised of multiplex images of three adjacent sections cut from a tissue microarray (TMA) carrying 59 cores from separate breast cancers and stained on different days, and one comprised of a pair of longitudinal biopsies obtained from one patient where tissue biopsy, fixation, processing and multiplexed staining/imaging were done at different times. We demonstrate that \textbf{RESTORE} can remove unwanted variations effectively and shows robust performance.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Because of the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, identifying a statistical test that is both valid and maximally sensitive is an important challenge. Here, we present a combination of two approaches for fMRI data analysis that together result in substantial improvements of the sensitivity of cluster-based statistics. The first approach is to create novel cluster definitions that are sensitive to physiologically plausible effect patterns. The second is to adopt a new approach to combine test statistics with different sensitivity profiles, which we call the min(p) method. These innovations are made possible by using the randomization inference framework. In this paper, we report on a set of simulations that demonstrate (1) that the proposed methods control the false-alarm rate, (2) that the sensitivity profiles of cluster-based test statistics vary depending on the cluster defining thresholds and cluster definitions, and (3) that the min(p) method for combining these test statistics results in a drastic increase of sensitivity (up to five-fold), compared to existing fMRI analysis methods. This increase in sensitivity is not at the expense of the spatial specificity of the inference.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Pioneering work in human neuroscience has relied on the ability to map brain function using task-based fMRI, but the empirical validity of these inferential methods is still being characterized. A recent landmark study by Eklund and colleagues showed that popular multiple comparison corrections based on cluster extent suffer from unexpectedly low specificity (i.e., high false positive rate). Yet that study’s focus on specificity, while important, is incomplete. The validity of a method depends also on its sensitivity (i.e., true positive rate or power), yet the sensitivity of cluster correction remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed the sensitivity of gold-standard nonparametric cluster correction by resampling real data from five tasks in the Human Connectome Project and comparing results with those from the full “ground truth” datasets (n ​= ​480–493). Critically, we found that sensitivity after correction is lower than may be practical for many fMRI applications. In particular, sensitivity to medium-sized effects ({\textbar}Cohen’s d{\textbar} ​= ​0.5) was less than 20\% across tasks on average, about three times smaller than without any correction. Furthermore, cluster extent correction exhibited a spatial bias in sensitivity that was independent of effect size. In comparison, correction based on the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) statistic approximately doubled sensitivity across tasks but increased spatial bias. These results suggest that we have, until now, only measured the tip of the iceberg in the activation-mapping literature due to our goal of limiting the familywise error rate through cluster extent-based inference. There is a need to revise our practices to improve sensitivity; we therefore conclude with a list of modern strategies to boost sensitivity while maintaining respectable specificity in future investigations.},

Intensity non-uniformity consists in anatomically irrelevant intensity variation throughout data. It can be induced by the choice of the radio-frequency coil, the acquisition pulse sequence and by the nature and geometry of the sample itself. Numerous methods have been proposed to correct this artifact. In this paper, we propose an overview of existing methods. We first sort them according to their location in the acquisition/processing pipeline. Sorting is then refined based on the assumptions those methods rely on. Next, we present the validation protocols used to evaluate these different correction schemes both from a qualitative and a quantitative point of view.

As with many other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting the need of correcting for site effects before performing downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization, may be counter-productive and negatively impacts the inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods in the presence of different levels of confounding between site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample size studies.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}To acquire larger samples for answering complex questions in neuroscience, researchers have increasingly turned to multi-site neuroimaging studies. However, these studies are hindered by differences in images acquired across multiple scanners. These effects have been shown to bias comparison between scanners, mask biologically meaningful associations, and even introduce spurious associations. To address this, the field has focused on harmonizing data by removing scanner-related effects in the mean and variance of measurements. Contemporaneously with the increase in popularity of multi-center imaging, the use of multivariate pattern analysis has also become commonplace. These approaches have been shown to provide improved sensitivity, specificity, and power due to their modeling the joint relationship across measurements in the brain. In this work, we demonstrate that the currently available methods for removing scanner effects are inherently insufficient for MVPA. This stems from the fact that no currently available harmonization approach has addressed how correlations between measurements can vary across scanners. Data from the Alzheimer9s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is used to show that considerable differences in covariance exist across scanners and that the state-of-the-art harmonization techniques do not address this issue. We also propose a novel methodology that harmonizes covariance of multivariate image measurements across scanners and demonstrate its improved performance in data harmonization, which further facilitates more power for detection of clinically relevant associations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Importance: United States government personnel experienced potential exposures to uncharacterized directional phenomena while serving in Havana, Cuba, from late 2016 through May 2018. The underlying neuroanatomical findings have not been described.
Objective: To examine potential differences in brain tissue volume, microstructure, and functional connectivity in government personnel compared with individuals not exposed to directional phenomena.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Forty government personnel (patients) who were potentially exposed and experienced neurological symptoms underwent evaluation at a US academic medical center from August 21, 2017, to June 8, 2018, including advanced structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging analytics. Findings were compared with imaging findings of 48 demographically similar healthy controls.
Exposures: Potential exposure to uncharacterized directional phenomena of unknown etiology, manifesting as pressure, vibration, or sound.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Potential imaging-based differences between patients and controls with regard to (1) white matter and gray matter total and regional brain volumes, (2) cerebellar tissue microstructure metrics (eg, mean diffusivity), and (3) functional connectivity in the visuospatial, auditory, and executive control subnetworks.
Results: Imaging studies were completed for 40 patients (mean age, 40.4 years; 23 [57.5\%] men; imaging performed a median of 188 [range, 4-403] days after initial exposure) and 48 controls (mean age, 37.6 years; 33 [68.8\%] men). Mean whole brain white matter volume was significantly smaller in patients compared with controls (patients: 542.22 cm3; controls: 569.61 cm3; difference, -27.39 [95\% CI, -37.93 to -16.84] cm3; P {\textless} .001), with no significant difference in the whole brain gray matter volume (patients: 698.55 cm3; controls: 691.83 cm3; difference, 6.72 [95\% CI, -4.83 to 18.27] cm3; P = .25). Among patients compared with controls, there were significantly greater ventral diencephalon and cerebellar gray matter volumes and significantly smaller frontal, occipital, and parietal lobe white matter volumes; significantly lower mean diffusivity in the inferior vermis of the cerebellum (patients: 7.71 × 10-4 mm2/s; controls: 8.98 × 10-4 mm2/s; difference, -1.27 × 10-4 [95\% CI, -1.93 × 10-4 to -6.17 × 10-5] mm2/s; P {\textless} .001); and significantly lower mean functional connectivity in the auditory subnetwork (patients: 0.45; controls: 0.61; difference, -0.16 [95\% CI, -0.26 to -0.05]; P = .003) and visuospatial subnetwork (patients: 0.30; controls: 0.40; difference, -0.10 [95\% CI, -0.16 to -0.04]; P = .002) but not in the executive control subnetwork (patients: 0.24; controls: 0.25; difference: -0.016 [95\% CI, -0.04 to 0.01]; P = .23).
Conclusions and Relevance: Among US government personnel in Havana, Cuba, with potential exposure to directional phenomena, compared with healthy controls, advanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant differences in whole brain white matter volume, regional gray and white matter volumes, cerebellar tissue microstructural integrity, and functional connectivity in the auditory and visuospatial subnetworks but not in the executive control subnetwork.

	abstract = {This article constructs simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) for functional parameters using the Gaussian Kinematic formula of \$t\$-processes (tGKF). Although the tGKF relies on Gaussianity, we show that a central limit theorem (CLT) for the parameter of interest is enough to obtain asymptotically precise covering rates even for non-Gaussian processes. As a proof of concept we study the functional signal-plus-noise model and derive a CLT for an estimator of the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, the only data dependent quantities in the tGKF SCBs. Extensions to discrete sampling with additive observation noise are discussed using scale space ideas from regression analysis. Here we provide sufficient conditions on the processes and kernels to obtain convergence of the functional scale space surface. The theoretical work is accompanied by a simulation study comparing different methods to construct SCBs for the population mean. We show that the tGKF works well even for small sample sizes and only a Rademacher multiplier-\$t\$ bootstrap performs similarily well. For larger sample sizes the tGKF often outperforms the bootstrap methods and is computational faster. We apply the method to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fibers using a scale space approach for the difference of population means. R code is available in our Rpackage SCBfda.},

Missing values can be filled in using multiple imputation, but imputation is tricky if the regression includes interactions, squares, or other transformations of the regressors. In this paper, we examine different approaches to imputing transformed variables; and we find one simple method that works well across a variety of circumstances. Our recommendation is to transform, then impute—i.e., calculate the interactions or squares in the incomplete data and then impute these transformations like any other variable. The transform-then-impute method yields good regression estimates, even though the imputed values are often inconsistent with one another. It is tempting to try and “fix” the inconsistencies in the imputed values, but methods that do so lead to biased regression estimates. Such biased methods include the passive imputation strategy implemented by the popular ice command for Stata.},

This article calls into question the optimism of this guideline and illustrates that important quantities (e.g., p values, confidence interval half-widths, and estimated fractions of missing information) suffer from substantial imprecision with a small number of imputations. Substantively, a researcher can draw categorically different conclusions about null hypothesis rejection, estimation precision, and missing information in distinct multiple imputation runs for the same data and analysis with few imputations. This article explores the factors associated with this imprecision, demonstrates that precision improves by increasing the number of imputations, and provides practical guidelines for choosing a reasonable number of imputations to reduce imprecision for each of these quantities.},

This approach often has substantial advantage, both in computation and accuracy, over more traditional bootstrap methods and it applies to a wide class of practical problems where the data are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. The methods allow for simultaneous estimation of vector parameters and their components. The authors use simulations to compare the EF bootstrap with competing methods in several examples including the common means problem and nonlinear regression.

	abstract = {Most of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies demonstrated the correlations between spatially distinct brain areas from the perspective of functional connectivity or functional integration. The functional connectivity approaches do not directly provide information of the amplitude of brain activity of each brain region within a network. Alternatively, an index named amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the resting-state fMRI signal has been suggested to reflect the intensity of regional spontaneous brain activity. However, it has been indicated that the ALFF is also sensitive to the physiological noise. The current study proposed a fractional ALFF (fALFF) approach, i.e., the ratio of power spectrum of low-frequency (0.01–0.08Hz) to that of the entire frequency range and this approach was tested in two groups of resting-state fMRI data. The results showed that the brain areas within the default mode network including posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior parietal lobule had significantly higher fALFF than the other brain areas. This pattern was consistent with previous neuroimaging results. The non-specific signal components in the cistern areas in resting-state fMRI were significantly suppressed, indicating that the fALFF approach improved the sensitivity and specificity in detecting spontaneous brain activities. Its mechanism and sensitivity to abnormal brain activity should be evaluated in the future studies.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in deciphering mechanisms of human brain cortical folding leave unexplained whether spatially patterned genetic influences contribute to this folding. High-resolution in vivo brain MRI can be used to estimate genetic correlations (covariability due to shared genetic factors) in interregional cortical thickness, and biomechanical studies predict an influence of cortical thickness on folding patterns. However, progress has been hampered because shared genetic influences related to folding patterns likely operate at a scale that is much more local ({\textless}1 cm) than that addressed in prior imaging studies. Here, we develop methodological approaches to examine local genetic influences on cortical thickness and apply these methods to two large, independent samples. We find that such influences are markedly heterogeneous in strength, and in some cortical areas are notably stronger in specific orientations relative to gyri or sulci. The overall, phenotypic local correlation has a significant basis in shared genetic factors and is highly symmetric between left and right cortical hemispheres. Furthermore, the degree of local cortical folding relates systematically with the strength of local correlations, which tends to be higher in gyral crests and lower in sulcal fundi. The relationship between folding and local correlations is stronger in primary sensorimotor areas and weaker in association areas such as prefrontal cortex, consistent with reduced genetic constraints on the structural topology of association cortex. Collectively, our results suggest that patterned genetic influences on cortical thickness, measurable at the scale of in vivo MRI, may be a causal factor in the development of cortical folding.},

	abstract = {Brain iron is vital to multiple aspects of brain function, including oxidative metabolism, myelination, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Atypical iron concentration in the basal ganglia is associated with neurodegenerative disorders in aging and cognitive deficits. However, the normative development of brain iron concentration in adolescence and its relationship to cognition are less well understood. Here, we address this gap in a longitudinal sample of 922 humans aged 8–26 years at the first visit (M = 15.1, SD = 3.72; 336 males, 486 females) with up to four multiecho T2* scans each. Using this sample of 1236 imaging sessions, we assessed the longitudinal developmental trajectories of tissue iron in the basal ganglia. We quantified tissue iron concentration using R2* relaxometry within four basal ganglia regions, including the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and globus pallidus. The longitudinal development of R2* was modeled using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) with splines to capture linear and nonlinear developmental processes. We observed significant increases in R2* across all regions, with the greatest and most prolonged increases occurring in the globus pallidus and putamen. Further, we found that the developmental trajectory of R2* in the putamen is significantly related to individual differences in cognitive ability, such that greater cognitive ability is increasingly associated with greater iron concentration through late adolescence and young-adulthood. Together, our results suggest a prolonged period of basal ganglia iron enrichment that extends into the mid-twenties, with diminished iron concentration associated with poorer cognitive ability during late adolescence.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Brain tissue iron is essential to healthy brain function. Atypical basal ganglia tissue iron levels have been linked to impaired cognition in iron deficient children and adults with neurodegenerative disorders. However, the normative developmental trajectory of basal ganglia iron concentration during adolescence and its association with cognition are less well understood. In the largest study of tissue iron development yet reported, we characterize the developmental trajectory of tissue iron concentration across the basal ganglia during adolescence and provide evidence that diminished iron content is associated with poorer cognitive performance even in healthy youth. These results highlight the transition from adolescence to adulthood as a period of dynamic maturation of tissue iron concentration in the basal ganglia.},

While some new methods have been proposed to more accurately account for such data, these methods are based on iterative algorithms that are slow and failure-prone. In this article, we propose the use of the Sandwich Estimator method which first estimates the parameters of interest with a simple Ordinary Least Square model and second estimates variances/covariances with the “so-called” Sandwich Estimator (SwE) which accounts for the within-subject correlation existing in longitudinal data. Here, we introduce the SwE method in its classic form, and we review and propose several adjustments to improve its behaviour, specifically in small samples. We use intensive Monte Carlo simulations to compare all considered adjustments and isolate the best combination for neuroimaging data. We also compare the SwE method to other popular methods and demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we analyse a highly unbalanced longitudinal dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and demonstrate the flexibility of the SwE method to fit within- and between-subject effects in a single model. Software implementing this SwE method has been made freely available at http://warwick.ac.uk/tenichols/SwE.},

However, these studies are hindered by differences in images acquired across different scanners, so-called scanner effects, in the raw images and derived measurements. These effects have been shown to bias comparison between scanners, mask biologically meaningful associations, and even introduce spurious associations. To address this, the field has focused on harmonizing data via removing the scanner differences in mean and variance of measurements. Contemporaneously with the increase in popularity of multi-center imaging, the use of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), which refers to machine learning and multivariate statistical techniques for group comparisons or predictive modeling, has also become commonplace. These approaches have been shown to provide improved sensitivity, specificity, and power due to their modeling the joint relationship across measurements in the brain. In this work, we demonstrate that these currently available methods for removing site effects are inherently insufficient for MVPA. This stems from the fact that no currently available harmonization approach has addressed how correlations between measurements can vary across sites. Using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, we show that considerable differences in covariance exist across sites, and that the state-of-the-art harmonization techniques do not address this issue. We also propose a novel methodology that harmonizes covariance of multivariate image measurements across sites and demonstrate its improved performance in data harmonization, which further facilitates more power for detection of clinically relevant associations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Appropriate imputation inference requires both an unbiased imputation estimator and an unbiased variance estimator. The commonly used variance estimator, proposed by Rubin, can be biased when the imputation and analysis models are misspecified and/or incompatible. Robins and Wang proposed an alternative approach, which allows for such misspecification and incompatibility, but it is considerably more complex. It is unknown whether in practice Robins and Wang’s multiple imputation procedure is an improvement over Rubin’s multiple imputation. We conducted a critical review of these two multiple imputation approaches, a re-sampling method called full mechanism bootstrapping and our modified Rubin’s multiple imputation procedure via simulations and an application to data. We explored four common scenarios of misspecification and incompatibility. In general, for a moderate sample size (n = 1000), Robins and Wang’s multiple imputation produced the narrowest confidence intervals, with acceptable coverage. For a small sample size (n = 100) Rubin’s multiple imputation, overall, outperformed the other methods. Full mechanism bootstrapping was inefficient relative to the other methods and required modelling of the missing data mechanism under the missing at random assumption. Our proposed modification showed an improvement over Rubin’s multiple imputation in the presence of misspecification. Overall, Rubin’s multiple imputation variance estimator can fail in the presence of incompatibility and/or misspecification. For unavoidable incompatibility and/or misspecification, Robins and Wang’s multiple imputation could provide more robust inferences.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

	abstract = {Background
Memory is significantly impaired in schizophrenia. However, memory measures are often complex and confounded by additional impairments such as motivation and task comprehension, which can affect behavioral performance and obscure neural function during memory tasks. Neural signatures of memory encoding that are robust to potential confounds may shed additional light on neural deficits contributing to memory impairment in schizophrenia.
Methods
Here, we investigate a potential neural signature of memory—habituation—and its relationship with healthy and impaired memory function. To limit potential confounds, we used a passive depth of encoding memory task designed to elicit neural responses associated with memory encoding while limiting other cognitive demands. To determine whether habituation during encoding was predictive of intact memory processing, we first compared neural habituation over repeated encoding exposures with subsequent explicit memory in healthy individuals. We then tested whether a similar relationship existed in patients with schizophrenia.
Results
Explicit memory performance was impaired in patients with schizophrenia relative to healthy control subjects. In healthy participants, more habituation over repeated exposures during encoding was associated with greater repetition-related increases in accuracy during testing. However, in patients with schizophrenia, better performance was associated with less habituation, or a more sustained neural response during encoding.
Conclusions
These results suggest that sustained neural activity is required for normal repetition-related improvements in memory performance in schizophrenia, in line with a neural inefficiency model. Habituation may serve as a valuable index of neural processes that underlie behavioral memory performance.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a formidable challenge for psychiatry and neuroscience because of their high prevalence, lifelong nature, complexity and substantial heterogeneity. Facing these obstacles requires large-scale multidisciplinary efforts. Although the field of genetics has pioneered data sharing for these reasons, neuroimaging had not kept pace. In response, we introduce the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)—a grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing 1112 existing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573 age-matched typical controls (TCs; 7–64 years) (http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). Here, we present this resource and demonstrate its suitability for advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on analyses of 360 male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We focused on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly disparate themes of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity in the ASD literature; both were detected, although hypoconnectivity dominated, particularly for corticocortical and interhemispheric functional connectivity. Exploratory analyses using an array of regional metrics of intrinsic brain function converged on common loci of dysfunction in ASDs (mid- and posterior insula and posterior cingulate cortex), and highlighted less commonly explored regions such as the thalamus. The survey of the ABIDE R-fMRI data sets provides unprecedented demonstrations of both replication and novel discovery. By pooling multiple international data sets, ABIDE is expected to accelerate the pace of discovery setting the stage for the next generation of ASD studies.},

	abstract = {The p-curve, the distribution of statistically significant p-values of published studies, has been used to make inferences on the proportion of true effects and on the presence of p-hacking in the published literature. We analyze the p-curve for observational research in the presence of p-hacking. We show by means of simulations that even with minimal omitted-variable bias (e.g., unaccounted confounding) p-curves based on true effects and p-curves based on null-effects with p-hacking cannot be reliably distinguished. We also demonstrate this problem using as practical example the evaluation of the effect of malaria prevalence on economic growth between 1960 and 1996. These findings call recent studies into question that use the p-curve to infer that most published research findings are based on true effects in the medical literature and in a wide range of disciplines. p-values in observational research may need to be empirically calibrated to be interpretable with respect to the commonly used significance threshold of 0.05. Violations of randomization in experimental studies may also result in situations where the use of p-curves is similarly unreliable.},

	abstract = {Here we address the current issues of inefficiency and over-penalization in the massively univariate approach followed by the correction for multiple testing, and propose a more efficient model that pools and shares information among brain regions. Using Bayesian multilevel (BML) modeling, we control two types of error that are more relevant than the conventional false positive rate (FPR): incorrect sign (type S) and incorrect magnitude (type M). BML also aims to achieve two goals: 1) improving modeling efficiency by having one integrative model and thereby dissolving the multiple testing issue, and 2) turning the focus of conventional null hypothesis significant testing (NHST) on FPR into quality control by calibrating type S errors while maintaining a reasonable level of inference efficiency. The performance and validity of this approach are demonstrated through an application at the region of interest (ROI) level, with all the regions on an equal footing: unlike the current approaches under NHST, small regions are not disadvantaged simply because of their physical size. In addition, compared to the massively univariate approach, BML may simultaneously achieve increased spatial specificity and inference efficiency, and promote results reporting in totality and transparency. The benefits of BML are illustrated in performance and quality checking using an experimental dataset. The methodology also avoids the current practice of sharp and arbitrary thresholding in the p-value funnel to which the multidimensional data are reduced. The BML approach with its auxiliary tools is available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.},

	abstract = {Background: Since the early 2010s, the neuroimaging field has paid more attention to the issue of false positives. Several journals have issued guidelines regarding statistical thresholds. Three papers have reported the statistical analysis of the thresholds used in fMRI literature, but they were published at least three years ago and surveyed papers published during 2007–2012. This study revisited this topic to evaluate the changes in this field. Methods: The PubMed database was searched to identify the task-based (not resting-state) fMRI papers published in 2017 and record their sample sizes, inferential methods (e.g. voxelwise or clusterwise), theoretical methods (e.g. parametric or non-parametric), significance level, cluster-defining primary threshold (CDT), volume of analysis (whole brain or region of interest) and software used. Results: The majority (95.6\%) of the 388 analyzed articles reported statistics corrected for multiple comparisons. A large proportion (69.6\%) of the 388 articles reported main results by clusterwise inference. The analyzed articles mostly used software Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) or FMRIB Software Library (FSL) to conduct statistical analysis. There were 70.9\%, 37.6\% and 23.1\% of SPM, AFNI and FSL studies, respectively, that used a CDT of p ≤ 0.001. The statistical sample size across the articles ranged between 7 and 1299 with a median of 33. Sample size did not significantly correlate with the level of statistical threshold. Conclusions: There were still around 53\% (142/270) studies using clusterwise inference that chose a more liberal CDT than p = 0.001 (n = 121) or did not report their CDT (n = 21), down from around 61\% reported by Woo et al. (2014). For FSL studies, it seemed that the CDT practice had no improvement since the survey by Woo et al. (2014). A few studies chose unconventional CDT such as p = 0.0125 or 0.004. Such practice might create an impression that the threshold alterations were attempted to show “desired” clusters. The median sample size used in the analyzed articles was similar to those reported in previous surveys. In conclusion, there seemed to be no change in the statistical practice compared to the early 2010s.},

	abstract = {Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (R-fMRI) holds the promise to reveal functional biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, extracting such biomarkers is challenging for complex multi-faceted neuropathologies, such as autism spectrum disorders. Large multi-site datasets increase sample sizes to compensate for this complexity, at the cost of uncontrolled heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises new challenges, akin to those face in realistic diagnostic applications. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of inter-site classification of neuropsychiatric status, with an application to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large (N=871) multi-site autism dataset. For this purpose, we investigate pipelines that extract the most predictive biomarkers from the data. These R-fMRI pipelines build participant-specific connectomes from functionally-defined brain areas. Connectomes are then compared across participants to learn patterns of connectivity that differentiate typical controls from individuals with autism. We predict this neuropsychiatric status for participants from the same acquisition sites or different, unseen, ones. Good choices of methods for the various steps of the pipeline lead to 67\% prediction accuracy on the full ABIDE data, which is significantly better than previously reported results. We perform extensive validation on multiple subsets of the data defined by different inclusion criteria. These enables detailed analysis of the factors contributing to successful connectome-based prediction. First, prediction accuracy improves as we include more subjects, up to the maximum amount of subjects available. Second, the definition of functional brain areas is of paramount importance for biomarker discovery: brain areas extracted from large R-fMRI datasets outperform reference atlases in the classification tasks.},

	abstract = {Developmental cognitive neuroscience is a rapidly growing field that examines the relationships between biological development and cognitive ability. In the past decade, there has been ongoing refinement of concepts and methodology related to the study of ‘functional connectivity’ among distributed brain regions believed to underlie cognition and behavioral control. Due to the recent availability of relatively easy-to-use tools for functional connectivity analysis, there has been a sharp upsurge of studies that seek to characterize normal and psychopathologically abnormal brain functional integration. However, relatively few studies have applied functional and effective connectivity analysis techniques to developmental cognitive neuroscience. Functional and effective connectivity analysis methods are ideally suited to advance our understanding of the neural substrates of cognitive development, particularly in understanding how and why changes in the functional ‘wiring’ of neural networks promotes optimal cognitive control throughout development. The purpose of this review is to summarize the central concepts, methods, and findings of functional integration neuroimaging research to discuss key questions in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience. These ideas will be presented within a context that merges relevant concepts and proposals from different developmental theorists. The review will outline a few general predictions about likely relationships between typical ‘executive’ cognitive maturation and changes in brain network functional integration during adolescence. Although not exhaustive, this conceptual review also will showcase some of recent findings that have emerged to support these predictions.},

These two approaches generally have tested different types of hypotheses using different analysis techniques. This has hampered the convergence of findings. Although much has been learned about system-wide changes to adolescents’ neural network organization, if both rs-fcMRI and t-fcMRI approaches draw upon each other's methodology and ask broader questions, it will produce a more detailed connectome-informed theory of adolescent neurodevelopment to guide physiological, clinical, and other lines of research.},

Cognitive neuroscience research in the last two decades has improved our understanding of adolescent brain development.

These changes are associated with a greater strengthening and separation of brain networks, both in terms of structure and function, as well as improved cognitive skills. Adolescent-specific sub-cortical reactivity to emotions and rewards, contrasted with their developing self-control skills, are thought to account for their greater sensitivity to the socio-affective context.

We propose a family of new procedures called the subcluster wild bootstrap, which includes the ordinary wild bootstrap as a limiting case. In the case of pure treatment models, where all observations within clusters are either treated or not, the latter procedure can work remarkably well. The key requirement is that all cluster sizes, regardless of treatment, should be similar. Unfortunately, the analogue of this requirement is not likely to hold for difference-in-differences regressions.

We also derive Edgeworth expansions for the asymptotic and bootstrap test statistics.

	abstract = {Many large-scale longitudinal imaging studies have been or are being widely conducted to better understand the progress of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and normal brain development. The goal of this article is to develop a multiscale adaptive generalized estimation equation (MAGEE) method for spatial and adaptive analysis of neuroimaging data from longitudinal studies. MAGEE is applicable to making statistical inference on regression coefficients in both balanced and unbalanced longitudinal designs and even in twin and familial studies, whereas standard software platforms have several major limitations in handling these complex studies. Specifically, conventional voxel-based analyses in these software platforms involve Gaussian smoothing imaging data and then independently fitting a statistical model at each voxel. However, the conventional smoothing methods suffer from the lack of spatial adaptivity to the shape and spatial extent of region of interest and the arbitrary choice of smoothing extent, while independently fitting statistical models across voxels does not account for the spatial properties of imaging observations and noise distribution. To address such drawbacks, we adapt a powerful propagation–separation (PS) procedure to sequentially incorporate the neighboring information of each voxel and develop a new novel strategy to solely update a set of parameters of interest, while fixing other nuisance parameters at their initial estimators. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that MAGEE significantly outperforms voxel-based analysis.},

We therefore infer on topological features of the signal, such as the existence of local maxima or peaks above some threshold. Using results from random field theory, we assign a p-value to each maximum in an SPM and identify an adaptive threshold that controls false discovery rate, using the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure (1995). This provides a natural complement to conventional family wise error (FWE) control on local maxima. We use simulations to contrast these procedures; both in terms of their relative number of discoveries and their spatial accuracy (via the distribution of the Euclidian distance between true and discovered activations). We also assessed two other procedures: cluster-wise and voxel-wise FDR procedures. Our results suggest that (a) FDR control of maxima or peaks is more sensitive than FWE control of peaks with minimal cost in terms of false-positives, (b) voxel-wise FDR is substantially less accurate than topological FWE or FDR control. Finally, we present an illustrative application using an fMRI study of visual attention.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Humans place high value on how they are socially evaluated by others. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is a well-established measure of social evaluative threat that promotes activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and release of cortisol. Higher cortisol responses in typically developing (TD) adolescents are influenced by age and pubertal development especially in later stages. Children with ASD have been shown to exhibit blunted cortisol in response to the TSST although adults with ASD show a more prototypical response. The current study examined physiological stress in early adolescents with ASD and TD. It was hypothesized that TD youth would show elevated cortisol in response to the TSST influenced by age and pubertal stage. In contrast, youth with ASD would show a more diminished stress response yet still show effects for age and pubertal development
Methods
The sample included 241 youth, 138 with ASD (median age=11.25) and 103 TD (median age=11.67). Standardized diagnostic and pubertal development (genital/breast (GB), and pubic hair (PH) stage) physical exams were performed. Salivary cortisol was collected before and after the TSST. Linear mixed effects models examined the effects of baseline cortisol, time, age, sex, pubertal stage, and diagnosis.
Results
We did not find an effect of early pubertal development stage (GB or PH) on cortisol response. There was an interaction between age and TSST timepoint, showing stronger effects for older children across the timeline especially during the stressor. Finally, there was a significant diagnosis by TSST timepoint interaction characterized by a blunted cortisol stress response in youth with ASD compared to TD participants who showed higher cortisol.
Discussion
We found evidence that age contributes to an increase in cortisol in response to social evaluative threat during early adolescence. TD youth exhibit an adaptive elevated stress response to psychosocial threat whereas youth with ASD do not. There may exist a developmental lag in the perception of and stress responsivity to social evaluation which may emerge in older adolescents with ASD.},

IHI was more prevalent (left hemisphere: 15\% of healthy control participants, 27\% of schizophrenia patients; right hemisphere: 4\% of healthy control participants, 10\% of schizophrenia patients) and more severe in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy control participants. Severe IHI cases were associated with a higher rate of automated segmentation failure. IHI contributed to smaller hippocampal volume and increased R {\textgreater} L volume asymmetry in schizophrenia. The increased prevalence and severity of IHI supports the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia.

Failure to remove these unwanted artifacts will complicate downstream analysis and diminish the value of multiplexed imaging for clinical applications. Here, to compensate for unwanted variations, we automatically identify negative control cells for each marker within the same tissue and use their expression levels to infer background signal level. The intensity profile is normalized by the inferred level of the negative control cells to remove between-sample variation. Using a tissue microarray data and a pair of longitudinal biopsy samples, we demonstrated that the proposed approach can remove unwanted variations effectively and shows robust performance.},

Cluster extent is sensitive to spatially extended signals while voxel intensity is better for intense but focal signals. In order to leverage strength from both statistics, several nonparametric permutation methods have been proposed to combine the two methods. Simulation studies have shown that of the different cluster permutation methods, the cluster mass statistic is generally the best. However, to date, there is no parametric cluster mass inference available. In this paper, we propose a cluster mass inference method based on random field theory (RFT). We develop this method for Gaussian images, evaluate it on Gaussian and Gaussianized t-statistic images and investigate its statistical properties via simulation studies and real data. Simulation results show that the method is valid under the null hypothesis and demonstrate that it can be more powerful than the cluster extent inference method. Further, analyses with a single subject and a group fMRI dataset demonstrate better power than traditional cluster size inference, and good accuracy relative to a gold-standard permutation test.},

The authors describe novel methods for economically ascertaining probability distributions under the null hypothesis, with fewer assumptions, by permutation of the observed data. Nominal Type I error control by permutation testing is generally excellent; whereas theoretical distributions may be over conservative. Permutation has the additional advantage that it can be used to test any statistic of interest, such as the sum of suprathreshold voxel statistics in a cluster (or cluster mass), regardless of its theoretical tractability under the null hypothesis.

	abstract = {In a massively univariate analysis of brain image data, statistical inference is typically based on intensity or spatial extent of signals. Voxel intensity-based tests provide great sensitivity for high intensity signals, whereas cluster extent-based tests are sensitive to spatially extended signals. To benefit from the strength of both, the intensity and extent information needs to be combined. Various ways of combining voxel intensity and cluster extent are possible, and a few such combining methods have been proposed. Poline et al.'s [NeuroImage 16 (1997) 83] minimum P value approach is sensitive to signals whose either intensity or extent is significant. Bullmore et al.'s [IEEE Trans. Med. Imag. 18 (1999) 32] cluster mass method can detect signals whose intensity and extent are sufficiently large, even when they are not significant by intensity or extent alone. In this work, we study such combined inference methods using combining functions (Pesarin, F., 2001. Multivariate Permutation Tests. Wiley, New York) and permutation framework [Holmes et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 16 (1996) 7], which allow us to examine different ways of combining voxel intensity and cluster extent information without knowing their distribution. We also attempt to calibrate combined inference by using weighted combining functions, which adjust the test according to signals of interest. Furthermore, we propose meta-combining, a combining function of combining functions, which integrates strengths of multiple combining functions into a single statistic. We found that combined tests are able to detect signals that are not detected by voxel or cluster size test alone. We also found that the weighted combining functions can calibrate the combined test according to the signals of interest, emphasizing either intensity or extent as appropriate. Though not necessarily more sensitive than individual combining functions, the meta-combining function is sensitive to all types of signals and thus can be used as a single test summarizing all the combining functions.},

	abstract = {In the context of neuroimaging experiments, it is essential to account for the multiple comparisons problem when thresholding statistical mappings. Various methods are in use to deal with this issue, but they differ in their signal detection power for small- and large-scale effects. In this paper, we comprehensively describe a new method that is based on control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method increases sensitivity by exploiting the spatially clustered nature of neuroimaging effects. This is achieved by using a sliding window technique, in which FDR-control is first applied at a regional level. Thus, a new statistical map that is related to the regionally achieved FDR is derived from the available voxelwise P-values. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, thresholding based on this map is demonstrated to have better discriminatory power than conventional thresholding based on P-values. Secondly, it is shown that the resulting maps can be thresholded at a level that results in control of the global FDR. By means of statistical arguments and numerical simulations under widely varying conditions, our method is validated, characterized, and compared to some other common voxel-based methods (uncorrected thresholding, Bonferroni correction, and conventional FDR-control). It is found that our method shows considerably higher sensitivity as compared to conventional FDR-control, while still controlling the achieved FDR at the same level or better. Finally, our method is applied to two diverse neuroimaging experiments to assess its practical merits, resulting in substantial improvements as compared to the other methods.},

	abstract = {The threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) approach integrates cluster information into voxel-wise statistical inference to enhance detectability of neuroimaging signal. Despite the significantly increased sensitivity, the application of TFCE is limited by several factors: (i) generalisation to data structures, like brain network connectivity data is not trivial, (ii) TFCE values are in an arbitrary unit, therefore, P-values can only be obtained by a computationally demanding permutation-test. Here, we introduce a probabilistic approach for TFCE (pTFCE), that gives a simple general framework for topology-based belief boosting. The core of pTFCE is a conditional probability, calculated based on Bayes' rule, from the probability of voxel intensity and the threshold-wise likelihood function of the measured cluster size. In this paper, we provide an estimation of these distributions based on Gaussian Random Field theory. The conditional probabilities are then aggregated across cluster-forming thresholds by a novel incremental aggregation method. pTFCE is validated on simulated and real fMRI data. The results suggest that pTFCE is more robust to various ground truth shapes and provides a stricter control over cluster "leaking" than TFCE and, in many realistic cases, further improves its sensitivity. Correction for multiple comparisons can be trivially performed on the enhanced P-values, without the need for permutation testing, thus pTFCE is well-suitable for the improvement of statistical inference in any neuroimaging workflow. Implementation of pTFCE is available at https://spisakt.github.io/pTFCE.},

	abstract = {The most prevalent approach to activation localization in neuroimaging is to identify brain regions as contiguous supra-threshold clusters, check their significance using random field theory, and correct for the multiple clusters being tested. Besides recent criticism on the validity of the random field assumption, a spatial specificity paradox remains: the larger the detected cluster, the less we know about the location of activation within that cluster. This is because cluster inference implies “there exists at least one voxel with an evoked response in the cluster”, and not that “all the voxels in the cluster have an evoked response”. Inference on voxels within selected clusters is considered bad practice, due to the voxel-wise false positive rate inflation associated with this circular inference. Here, we propose a remedy to the spatial specificity paradox. By applying recent results from the multiple testing statistical literature, we are able to quantify the proportion of truly active voxels within selected clusters, an approach we call All-Resolutions Inference (ARI). If this proportion is high, the paradox vanishes. If it is low, we can further “drill down” from the cluster level to sub-regions, and even to individual voxels, in order to pinpoint the origin of the activation. In fact, ARI allows inference on the proportion of activation in all voxel sets, no matter how large or small, however these have been selected, all from the same data. We use two fMRI datasets to demonstrate the non-triviality of the spatial specificity paradox, and its resolution using ARI. We verify that the endless circularity permitted by ARI does not render its estimates overly conservative using both simulation, and a data split.},

	abstract = {Permutation tests are increasingly being used as a reliable method for inference in neuroimaging analysis. However, they are computationally intensive. For small, non-imaging datasets, recomputing a model thousands of times is seldom a problem, but for large, complex models this can be prohibitively slow, even with the availability of inexpensive computing power. Here we exploit properties of statistics used with the general linear model (GLM) and their distributions to obtain accelerations irrespective of generic software or hardware improvements. We compare the following approaches: (i) performing a small number of permutations; (ii) estimating the p-value as a parameter of a negative binomial distribution; (iii) fitting a generalised Pareto distribution to the tail of the permutation distribution; (iv) computing p-values based on the expected moments of the permutation distribution, approximated from a gamma distribution; (v) direct fitting of a gamma distribution to the empirical permutation distribution; and (vi) permuting a reduced number of voxels, with completion of the remainder using low rank matrix theory. Using synthetic data we assessed the different methods in terms of their error rates, power, agreement with a reference result, and the risk of taking a different decision regarding the rejection of the null hypotheses (known as the resampling risk). We also conducted a re-analysis of a voxel-based morphometry study as a real-data example. All methods yielded exact error rates. Likewise, power was similar across methods. Resampling risk was higher for methods (i), (iii) and (v). For comparable resampling risks, the method in which no permutations are done (iv) was the absolute fastest. All methods produced visually similar maps for the real data, with stronger effects being detected in the family-wise error rate corrected maps by (iii) and (v), and generally similar to the results seen in the reference set. Overall, for uncorrected p-values, method (iv) was found the best as long as symmetric errors can be assumed. In all other settings, including for familywise error corrected p-values, we recommend the tail approximation (iii).

	abstract = {Microvessel density (MVD) has been reported to have prognostic relevance for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, this finding is controversial because of the difficulty of MVD evaluation in this complex vascularized tumor type. The present study evaluates the use of an automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) system for objective and reproducible determination of tumor vascularization in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The AQUA system was applied to tissue microarrays with 284 primary ccRCC tumors. To determine angiogenesis in ccRCC, we created an epithelial/stromal mask consisting of CD10, epithelial membrane antigen, and vimentin to distinguish epithelial tumor cells from CD34-positive endothelial cells. Using immunofluorescence and computer-aided quantification of CD34 expression, we measured the relative microvessel area (MVA) and compared the MVA to the manually counted MVD. The MVA determined by AQUA in a test set with 209 ccRCCs ranged from 0\% to 30.3\% (mean ± SD, 10.1\% ± 6.3\%). The manually determined MVD ranged from 6 to 987 vessels/mm2 (416.8 ± 252.8 vessels/mm2). MVA and MVD were significantly correlated (P {\textless} .001). A larger MVA was associated with histologic grade (P {\textless} .001), tumor stage (P =.008), presence of metastasis (P = .005), presence of sarcomatoid areas (P {\textless} .001), and tumor-specific survival (P {\textless} .001). Using MVA as defined in the test set, all associationswith clinical and pathologic parameters were confirmed in a second independent validation set. MVA determination by AQUA is an objective and reliable method to quantify tumor vascularization in ccRCC. A large MVA correlates with a high MVD and is associated with better patient prognosis.},

The convergence proof is based on describing the statistics of our estimator using waiting-times distributions, as the exponential or Erlang. We illustrate the proposed estimators and show how they compare to existing methods based on density estimation, and we also outline how our divergence estimators can be used for solving the two-sample problem.},

	abstract = {study of mapping and interaction of co-localized proteins at a sub-cellular level is important for understanding complex biological phenomena. One of the recent techniques to map co-localized proteins is to use the standard immuno-fluorescence microscopy in a cyclic manner (Nat Biotechnol 24:1270–8, 2006; Proc Natl Acad Sci 110:11982–7, 2013). Unfortunately, these techniques suffer from variability in intensity and positioning of signals from protein markers within a run and across different runs. Therefore, it is necessary to standardize protocols for preprocessing of the multiplexed bioimaging (MBI) data from multiple runs to a comparable scale before any further analysis can be performed on the data. In this paper, we compare various normalization protocols and propose on the basis of the obtained results, a robust normalization technique that produces consistent results on the MBI data collected from different runs using the Toponome Imaging System (TIS). Normalization results produced by the proposed method on a sample TIS data set for colorectal cancer patients were ranked favorably by two pathologists and two biologists. We show that the proposed method produces higher between class Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and lower within class KL divergence on a distribution of cell phenotypes from colorectal cancer and histologically normal samples.},

The method is extended to cover nonlinear parameters, regression \$M\$-estimators, nonlinear regression and generalized linear models. Interval estimators can be constructed from the jackknife histogram. Three bootstrap methods are considered. Two are shown to give biased variance estimators and one does not have the bias-robustness property enjoyed by the weighted delete-one jackknife. A general method for resampling residuals is proposed. It gives variance estimators that are bias-robust. Several bias-reducing estimators are proposed. Some simulation results are reported.},

	abstract = {The National Institute of Mental Health strategic plan for advancing psychiatric neuroscience calls for an acceleration of discovery and the delineation of developmental trajectories for risk and resilience across the lifespan. To attain these objectives, sufficiently powered datasets with broad and deep phenotypic characterization, state-of-the-art neuroimaging, and genetic samples must be generated and made openly available to the scientific community. The enhanced Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) is a response to this need. NKI-RS is an ongoing, institutionally-centered endeavor aimed at creating a large-scale (N\&gt;1000), deeply phenotyped, community-ascertained, lifespan sample (ages 6-85 years old) with advanced neuroimaging and genetics. These data will be publically shared, openly and prospectively (i.e., on a weekly basis). Herein, we describe the conceptual basis of the NKI-RS, including study design, sampling considerations, and steps to synchronize phenotypic and neuroimaging assessment. Additionally, we describe our process for sharing the data with the scientific community while protecting participant confidentiality, maintaining an adequate database, and certifying data integrity. The pilot phase of the NKI-RS, including challenges in recruiting, characterizing, imaging, and sharing data, is discussed while also explaining how this experience informed the final design of the enhanced NKI-RS. It is our hope that familiarity with the conceptual underpinnings of the enhanced NKI-RS will facilitate harmonization with future data collection efforts aimed at advancing psychiatric neuroscience and nosology.},

Increased understanding of the neurobiology of sex-based differences in variability across the lifespan can provide insight into both disease vulnerability and resilience. In n = 3069 participants, from 8 to 95 years of age, we found widespread greater variability in males compared with females in cortical surface area and global and subcortical volumes for discrete brain regions. In contrast, variance in cortical thickness was similar for males and females. These findings were supported by multivariate analysis accounting for structural covariance, and present and stable across the lifespan. Additionally, we examined variability among brain regions by sex. We found significant age-by-sex interactions across neuroimaging metrics, whereby in very early life males had reduced among-region variability compared with females, while in very late life this was reversed. Overall, our findings of greater regional variability, but less among-region variability in males in early life may aid our understanding of sex-based risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. In contrast, our findings in late life may provide a potential sex-based risk mechanism for dementia.},

T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired in 411 subjects aged 44–48 from a random community sample and optimized voxel-based morphometry was applied to detect regional GM difference between men and women, correcting for effects of age, years of education, handedness, and total intracranial volume (TIV). Men had larger brain volumes and higher white matter (WM) to TIV ratios compared with women. Women had higher GM to TIV ratios than men. After controlling for age, years of education, handedness, and TIV, there were no significant differences between men and women in the total GM volumes. Regional sex dimorphism was present, with men having more GM volume in midbrain, left inferior temporal gyrus, right occipital lingual gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, and both cerebellar hemispheres. Women showed more GM in dorsal anterior, posterior and ventral cingulate cortices, and right inferior parietal lobule. Our results suggest sex dimorphism in GM in middle aged healthy individuals, which is not likely to be explained by brain pathology. These differences may provide the structural brain basis for sex differences in certain cognitive functions.},

The only U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved histopathology biomarker tests for anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 therapy is assessment of PD-L1 protein expression by means of immunohistochemistry. This approach is unidimensional and has limitations. Innovative characterization of the tumor microenvironment (TME) with a focus on multidimensional, spatially resolved interactions at the single-cell level will provide critical mechanistic insights into therapeutic responses and potentially identify improved biomarkers for patient selection. Using multispectral approaches to image the TME and substituting cells for stars and galaxies, we applied the methodology and infrastructure developed for astronomy to pathologic analysis of specimens from patients with melanoma.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}RATIONALE{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The next generation of pathologic analyses will require platforms that can characterize the coexpression of key molecules on specific cellular subsets in situ and spatial relationships between tumor cells and multiple immune elements. To that aim, we applied astronomical algorithms for high-quality imaging and the establishment of relational databases to multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) labeling of pathology specimens, facilitating spatial analyses and immunoarchitectural characterization of the host-tumor interface. In all, we curated and coordinately mapped six markers, both individually and in combination in tumor tissue from 98 patients with melanoma receiving anti–PD-1 therapy. This dataset comprised {\textasciitilde}127,400 image mosaics composed of more than 100 million single cells. The data outputs were linked to patient outcomes, informing in a clinically relevant way how cancer evades the immune system and potentiating biomarker assay development for precision immunotherapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}RESULTS{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The imaging protocols used in this study were used to address outstanding questions regarding the impact of high-power field sampling strategies on biomarker performance. This information was then used to develop an approach for operator-independent field selection. The image handling strategies also facilitated the robust assessment of the intensity of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in situ (negative, low, mid, and high levels) on different cell types. Thus, with only six markers (PD-1, PD-L1, CD8, FoxP3, CD163, and Sox10/S100), we were able to develop 41 combinations of expression patterns for these molecules and map relatively rare cells such as CD8$^{\textrm{+}}$FoxP3$^{\textrm{+}}$ cells to the tumor stromal boundary. Moreover, a high density of CD8$^{\textrm{+}}$FoxP3$^{\textrm{+}}$PD-1$^{\textrm{low/mid}}$ cells was closely associated with response to PD-1 blockade. Cell types associated with a lack of response to therapy were also identified—for example, CD163$^{\textrm{+}}$ macrophages that were PD-L1$^{\textrm{–}}$. This latter phenotype was also found to have a negative effect on long-term survival. When these and other key cell phenotype densities were combined, they were highly predictive of objective response and stratified long-term patient outcomes after anti–PD-1–based therapies in both a discovery cohort and an independent validation cohort.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}CONCLUSION{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Here, we present the AstroPath platform, an end-to-end pathology workflow with rigorous quality control for creating quantitative, spatially resolved mIF datasets. Although the current effort focused on a six-plex mIF assay, the principles described here provide a general framework for the development of any multiplex assay with single-cell image resolution. Such approaches will vastly improve the standardization and scalability of these technologies, enabling cross-site and cross-study comparisons. This will be essential for multiplex imaging technologies to realize their potential as biomarker discovery platforms and ultimately as standard diagnostic tests for clinical therapeutic decision-making.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These "scanner effects" can hinder detection of biological features of interest, produce inconsistent results, and lead to spurious associations. We propose mica (multisite image harmonization by cumulative distribution function alignment), a tool to harmonize images taken on different scanners by identifying and removing within-subject scanner effects. Our goals in the present study were to (1) establish a method that removes scanner effects by leveraging multiple scans collected on the same subject, and, building on this, (2) develop a technique to quantify scanner effects in large multisite studies so these can be reduced as a preprocessing step. We illustrate scanner effects in a brain MRI study in which the same subject was measured twice on seven scanners, and assess our method's performance in a second study in which ten subjects were scanned on two machines. We found that unharmonized images were highly variable across site and scanner type, and our method effectively removed this variability by aligning intensity distributions. We further studied the ability to predict image harmonization results for a scan taken on an existing subject at a new site using cross-validation.},

	abstract = {Cancer development is a complex process driven by inherited and acquired molecular and cellular alterations. Prevention is the holy grail of cancer elimination, but making this a reality will take a fundamental rethinking and deep understanding of premalignant biology. In this Perspective, we propose a national concerted effort to create a Precancer Atlas (PCA), integrating multi-omics and immunity - basic tenets of the neoplastic process. The biology of neoplasia caused by germline mutations has led to paradigm-changing precision prevention efforts, including: tumor testing for mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in Lynch syndrome establishing a new paradigm, combinatorial chemoprevention efficacy in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), signal of benefit from imaging-based early detection research in high-germline risk for pancreatic neoplasia, elucidating early ontogeny in BRCA1-mutation carriers leading to an international breast cancer prevention trial, and insights into the intricate germline-somatic-immunity interaction landscape. Emerging genetic and pharmacologic (metformin) disruption of mitochondrial (mt) respiration increased autophagy to prevent cancer in a Li-Fraumeni mouse model (biology reproduced in clinical pilot) and revealed profound influences of subtle changes in mt DNA background variation on obesity, aging, and cancer risk. The elaborate communication between the immune system and neoplasia includes an increasingly complex cellular microenvironment and dynamic interactions between host genetics, environmental factors, and microbes in shaping the immune response. Cancer vaccines are in early murine and clinical precancer studies, building on the recent successes of immunotherapy and HPV vaccine immune prevention. Molecular monitoring in Barrett's esophagus to avoid overdiagnosis/treatment highlights an important PCA theme. Next generation sequencing (NGS) discovered age-related clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Ultra-deep NGS reports over the past year have redefined the premalignant landscape remarkably identifying tiny clones in the blood of up to 95\% of women in their 50s, suggesting that potentially premalignant clones are ubiquitous. Similar data from eyelid skin and peritoneal and uterine lavage fluid provide unprecedented opportunities to dissect the earliest phases of stem/progenitor clonal (and microenvironment) evolution/diversity with new single-cell and liquid biopsy technologies. Cancer mutational signatures reflect exogenous or endogenous processes imprinted over time in precursors. Accelerating the prevention of cancer will require a large-scale, longitudinal effort, leveraging diverse disciplines (from genetics, biochemistry, and immunology to mathematics, computational biology, and engineering), initiatives, technologies, and models in developing an integrated multi-omics and immunity PCA - an immense national resource to interrogate, target, and intercept events that drive oncogenesis.

	abstract = {In the frame of 3D medical imaging, accurate segmentation of multimodal brain MR images is of interest for many brain disorders. However, due to several factors such as noise, imaging artifacts, intrinsic tissue variation and partial volume effects, tissue classification remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a unifying framework for unsupervised segmentation of multimodal brain MR images including partial volume effect, bias field correction, and information given by a probabilistic atlas. Here-proposed method takes into account neighborhood information using a Hidden Markov Chain (HMC) model. Due to the limited resolution of imaging devices, voxels may be composed of a mixture of different tissue types, this partial volume effect is included to achieve an accurate segmentation of brain tissues. Instead of assigning each voxel to a single tissue class (i.e., hard classification), we compute the relative amount of each pure tissue class in each voxel (mixture estimation). Further, a bias field estimation step is added to the proposed algorithm to correct intensity inhomogeneities. Furthermore, atlas priors were incorporated using probabilistic brain atlas containing prior expectations about the spatial localization of different tissue classes. This atlas is considered as a complementary sensor and the proposed method is extended to multimodal brain MRI without any user-tunable parameter (unsupervised algorithm). To validate this new unifying framework, we present experimental results on both synthetic and real brain images, for which the ground truth is available. Comparison with other often used techniques demonstrates the accuracy and the robustness of this new Markovian segmentation scheme.},

Here we introduce an automated method using probabilistic reasoning over both space and time to segment brain tumors from 4D spatio-temporal MRI data. The 3D expectation-maximization method is extended using the hidden Markov model to infer tumor classification based on previous and subsequent segmentation results. Spatial coherence via a Markov Random Field was included in the 3D spatial model. Simulated images as well as patient images from three independent sources were used to validate this method. The sensitivity and specificity of tumor segmentation using this spatio-temporal model is improved over commonly used spatial or temporal models alone.},

For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80\%, whereas in practice less than 40\% of the studies selected from different areas of psychology can be replicated. Researchers in cognitive psychology are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants. Our analyses can easily be applied to new datasets gathered.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is one of the few measurement technology s of biochemistry which, given a thin sample, is able to reveal its spatial chemical composition in the full molecular range. IMS produces a hyperspectral image, where for each pixel a high-dimensional mass spectrum is measured. Currently, the technology is mature enough and one of the major problems preventing its spreading is the under-development of computational methods for mining huge IMS datasets. This article proposes a novel approach for spatial segmentation of an IMS dataset, which is constructed considering the important issue of pixel-to-pixel variability., Methods: We segment pixels by clustering their mass spectra. Importantly, we incorporate spatial relations between pixels into clustering, so that pixels are clustered together with their neighbors. We propose two methods. One is non-adaptive, where pixel neighborhoods are selected in the same manner for all pixels. The second one respects the structure observable in the data. For a pixel, its neighborhood is defined taking into account similarity of its spectrum to the spectra of adjacent pixels. Both methods have the linear complexity and require linear memory space (in the number of spectra)., Results: The proposed segmentation methods are evaluated on two IMS datasets: a rat brain section and a section of a neuroendocrine tumor. They discover anatomical structure, discriminate the tumor region and highlight functionally similar regions. Moreover, our methods provide segmentation maps of similar or better quality if compared to the other state-of-the-art methods, but outperform them in runtime and/or required memory., Contact: theodore@math.uni-bremen.de},

	abstract = {Finite mixtures of (multivariate) Gaussian distributions have broad utility, including their usage for model-based clustering. There is increasing recognition of mixtures of asymmetric distributions as powerful alternatives to traditional mixtures of Gaussian and mixtures of t distributions. The present work contributes to that assertion by addressing some facets of estimation and inference for mixtures-of-gamma distributions, including in the context of model-based clustering. Maximum likelihood estimation of mixtures of gammas is performed using an expectation–conditional–maximization (ECM) algorithm. The Wilson–Hilferty normal approximation is employed as part of an effective starting value strategy for the ECM algorithm, as well as provides insight into an effective model-based clustering strategy. Inference regarding the appropriateness of a common-shape mixture-of-gammas distribution is motivated by theory from research on infant habituation. We provide extensive simulation results that demonstrate the strong performance of our routines as well as analyze two real data examples: an infant habituation dataset and a whole genome duplication dataset.},

	abstract = {The identification of sub-populations of patients with similar characteristics, called patient subtyping, is important for realizing the goals of precision medicine. Accurate subtyping is crucial for tailoring therapeutic strategies that can potentially lead to reduced mortality and morbidity. Model-based clustering, such as Gaussian mixture models, provides a principled and interpretable methodology that is widely used to identify subtypes. However, they impose identical marginal distributions on each variable; such assumptions restrict their modeling flexibility and deteriorates clustering performance.In this paper, we use the statistical framework of copulas to decouple the modeling of marginals from the dependencies between them. Current copula-based methods cannot scale to high dimensions due to challenges in parameter inference. We develop HD-GMCM, that addresses these challenges and, to our knowledge, is the first copula-based clustering method that can fit high-dimensional data. Our experiments on real high-dimensional gene-expression and clinical datasets show that HD-GMCM outperforms state-of-the-art model-based clustering methods, by virtue of modeling non-Gaussian data and being robust to outliers through the use of Gaussian mixture copulas. We present a case study on lung cancer data from TCGA. Clusters obtained from HD-GMCM can be interpreted based on the dependencies they model, that offers a new way of characterizing subtypes. Empirically, such modeling not only uncovers latent structure that leads to better clustering but also meaningful clinical subtypes in terms of survival rates of patients.An implementation of HD-GMCM in R is available at: https://bitbucket.org/cdal/hdgmcm/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Gene clustering analysis is found useful for discovering groups of correlated genes potentially co-regulated or associated to the disease or conditions under investigation. Many clustering methods including hierarchical clustering, K-means, PAM, SOM, mixture model-based clustering and tight clustering have been widely used in the literature. Yet no comprehensive comparative study has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.Results: In this paper, six gene clustering methods are evaluated by simulated data from a hierarchical log-normal model with various degrees of perturbation as well as four real datasets. A weighted Rand index is proposed for measuring similarity of two clustering results with possible scattered genes (i.e. a set of noise genes not being clustered). Performance of the methods in the real data is assessed by a predictive accuracy analysis through verified gene annotations. Our results show that tight clustering and model-based clustering consistently outperform other clustering methods both in simulated and real data while hierarchical clustering and SOM perform among the worst. Our analysis provides deep insight to the complicated gene clustering problem of expression profile and serves as a practical guideline for routine microarray cluster analysis.Contact: ctseng@pitt.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

GMCMs have attractive properties which make them highly flexible and therefore interesting alternatives to other well-established methods. However, parameter estimation is hard because of intrinsic identifiability issues and intractable likelihood functions. Both aforementioned papers discuss similar expectation-maximization-like algorithms as their pseudo maximum likelihood estimation procedure. We present and discuss an improved implementation in R of both classes of GMCMs along with various alternative optimization routines to the EM algorithm. The software is freely available in the R package GMCM. The implementation is fast, general, and optimized for very large numbers of observations.

	abstract = {Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging stack of technologies, which adds spatial dimension to conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing. New protocols, based on in situ sequencing or multiplexed RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization register positions of single molecules in fixed tissue slices. Analysis of such data at the level of individual cells, however, requires accurate identification of cell boundaries. While many existing methods are able to approximate cell center positions using nuclei stains, current protocols do not report robust signal on the cell membranes, making accurate cell segmentation a key barrier for downstream analysis and interpretation of the data. To address this challenge, we developed a tool for Bayesian Segmentation of Spatial Transcriptomics Data (Baysor), which optimizes segmentation considering the likelihood of transcriptional composition, size and shape of the cell. The Bayesian approach can take into account nuclear or cytoplasm staining, however can also perform segmentation based on the detected transcripts alone. We show that Baysor segmentation can in some cases nearly double the number of the identified cells, while reducing contamination. Importantly, we demonstrate that Baysor performs well on data acquired using five different spatially-resolved protocols, making it a useful general tool for analysis of high-resolution spatial data.},

Here, we present an unsupervised and annotation-free framework, termed ClusterMap, which incorporates physical proximity and gene identity of RNAs, formulates the task as a point pattern analysis problem, and thus defines biologically meaningful structures and groups. Specifically, ClusterMap precisely clusters RNAs into subcellular structures, cell bodies, and tissue regions in both two- and three-dimensional space, and consistently performs on diverse tissue types, including mouse brain, placenta, gut, and human cardiac organoids. We demonstrate ClusterMap to be broadly applicable to various in situ transcriptomic measurements to uncover gene expression patterns, cell-cell interactions, and tissue organization principles from high-dimensional transcriptomic images.},

Deciphering spatial phenotypic and molecular effects on the single-cell level is one of the grand challenges and a key to understanding the effects of cell–cell interactions and microenvironment. However, spatial information is usually overlooked by downstream data analyses, which usually consider single-cell read-out values as independent measurements for further averaging or clustering, thus disregarding spatial locations. With this work, we attempt to fill this gap. We developed a toolbox that allows one to test for the presence of a spatial effect in microscopy images of adherent cells and estimate the spatial scale of this effect. The proposed Python module can be used for any light microscopy images of cells as well as other types of single-cell data such as in situ transcriptomics or metabolomics. The input format of our package matches standard output formats from image analysis tools such as CellProfiler, Fiji, or Icy and thus makes our toolbox easy and straightforward to use, yet offering a powerful statistical approach for a wide range of applications. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

Unsupervised analysis of an imaging MS data set aims at finding hidden structures in the data with no a priori information used and is often exploited as the first step of imaging MS data analysis. We propose a novel, easy-to-use and easy-to-implement approach to answer one of the key questions of unsupervised analysis of imaging MS data: what do all m/z images look like? The key idea of the approach is to cluster all m/z images according to their spatial similarity so that each cluster contains spatially similar m/z images. We propose a visualization of both spatial and spectral information obtained using clustering that provides an easy way to understand what all m/z images look like. We evaluated the proposed approach on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging MS data sets of a rat brain coronal section and human larynx carcinoma and discussed several scenarios of data analysis.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that mIF is becoming an important tool for immune profiling the tumor microenvironment, further advancing our understanding of the interplay between cancer and the immune system, and identifying predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy. Expediting mIF discoveries is leading to improved diagnostic panels, whereas it is important that mIF protocols be standardized to facilitate their transition into clinical use. Manual processing of sections for mIF is time consuming and a potential source of variability across numerous samples. To increase reproducibility and throughput we demonstrate the use of an automated slide stainer for mIF incorporating tyramide signal amplification (TSA). We describe two panels aimed at characterizing the tumor immune microenvironment. Panel 1 included CD3, CD20, CD117, FOXP3, Ki67, pancytokeratins (CK), and DAPI, and Panel 2 included CD3, CD8, CD68, PD-1, PD-L1, CK, and DAPI. Primary antibodies were first tested by standard immunohistochemistry and single-plex IF, then multiplex panels were developed and images were obtained using a Vectra 3.0 multispectral imaging system. Various methods for image analysis (identifying cell types, determining cell densities, characterizing cell-cell associations) are outlined. These mIF protocols will be invaluable tools for immune profiling the tumor microenvironment.},

	abstract = {A major challenge in the analysis of highly multiplexed imaging data is the assignment of cells to a priori known cell types. Existing approaches typically solve this by clustering cells followed by manual annotation. However, these often require several subjective choices and cannot explicitly assign cells to an uncharacterized type. To help address these issues we present Astir, a probabilistic model to assign cells to cell types by integrating prior knowledge of marker proteins. Astir uses deep recognition neural networks for fast inference, allowing for annotations at the million-cell scale in the absence of a previously annotated reference. We apply Astir to over 2.4 million cells from suspension and imaging datasets and demonstrate its scalability, robustness to sample composition, and interpretable uncertainty estimates. We envision deployment of Astir either for a first broad cell type assignment or to accurately annotate cells that may serve as biomarkers in multiple disease contexts.

To overcome these issues, we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell-type marker genes to annotate single-cell RNA sequencing data into predefined or de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while controlling for batch and sample effects.

	abstract = {Spatial correlation modeling comprises both spatial autocorrelation and spatial cross-correlation processes. The spatial autocorrelation theory has been well-developed. It is necessary to advance the method of spatial cross-correlation analysis to supplement the autocorrelation analysis. This paper presents a set of models and analytical procedures for spatial cross-correlation analysis. By analogy with Moran’s index newly expressed in a spatial quadratic form, a theoretical framework is derived for geographical cross-correlation modeling. First, two sets of spatial cross-correlation coefficients are defined, including a global spatial cross-correlation coefficient and local spatial cross-correlation coefficients. Second, a pair of scatterplots of spatial cross-correlation is proposed, and the plots can be used to visually reveal the causality behind spatial systems. Based on the global cross-correlation coefficient, Pearson’s correlation coefficient can be decomposed into two parts: direct correlation (partial correlation) and indirect correlation (spatial cross-correlation). As an example, the methodology is applied to the relationships between China’s urbanization and economic development to illustrate how to model spatial cross-correlation phenomena. This study is an introduction to developing the theory of spatial cross-correlation, and future geographical spatial analysis might benefit from these models and indexes.},

	abstract = {Despite years of discovery and attempts at validation, few molecular biomarkers achieve acceptance in the clinical setting. Tissue-based markers evaluated by immunohistochemistry suffer from a high degree of inter- and intraobserver variability. One recent advance in this field that promises to automate this process is the development of AQUA, a molecular-based method of quantitative assessment of protein expression. This system integrates a set of algorithms that allows for the rapid, automated, continuous, and quantitative analysis of tissue samples, including the separation of tumor from stromal elements and the subcellular localization of signals. This study uses the AQUA system to assess a recently described prostate cancer biomarker, α-methylacyl-CoA-racemase (AMACR), and to determine the effectiveness of the quantitative measurement of this marker as a means for making the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Using a prostate cancer progression tissue microarray containing a wide range of prostate tissues, AQUA was directly compared to standard immunohistochemical evaluation for AMACR protein expression using the p504s monoclonal antibody. Both methods produced similar results showing AMACR protein expression to be strongest in the clinically localized prostate cancer, followed by the metastatic tumor samples. Benign prostate tissue was categorized as negative for most tissue samples by immunohistochemistry. However, AMACR was detectable using the AQUA system at low levels using the standard 1:25 dilution but also at 1:250 dilution, which is not detectable by light microscopy. The AQUA system was also able to discriminate foamy gland prostate cancers, which are known to have a lower AMACR expression than typical acinar prostate cancers, from benign prostate tissue samples. Finally, a receiver-operating-characteristic curve was plotted to determine the specificity of the AMACR AQUA Z-score (normalized AQUA score) to predict that a given tissue microarray sample contains cancer. The area under the curve was calculated at 0.90 (P {\textless} 0.00001; 95\% CI, 0.84 to 0.95). At an AMACR AQUA Z-score score of −0.3, 91\% of the 70 samples classified as prostate cancer were correctly categorized without the intervention of a pathologist reviewing the tissue microarray slide. In conclusion, the AQUA system provides a continuous measurement of AMACR on a wide range of prostate tissue samples. In the future, the AMACR AQUA Z-score may be useful in the automated screening and evaluation of prostate tissue biomarkers.},

This potential is limited by uncertainties in assessing the significance of these maps. In this report, we describe an approach that may partially resolve this issue. A distinction is made between using SPMs as images of change significance and using them to identify foci of significant change. In the first case, the SPM can be reported nonselectively as a single mathematical object with its omnibus significance. Alternatively, the SPM constitutes a large number of repeated measures over the brain. To reject the null hypothesis, that no change has occurred at a specific location, a threshold adjustment must be made that accounts for the large number of comparisons made. This adjustment is shown to depend on the SPM's smoothness. Smoothness can be determined empirically and be used to calculate a threshold required to identify significant foci. The approach models the SPM as a stationary stochastic process. The theory and applications are illustrated using uniform phantom images and data from a verbal fluency activation study of four normal subjects.},

	abstract = {Mixture models are useful in a wide array of applications to identify subpopulations in noisy overlapping distributions. For example, in multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF), cell image intensities represent expression levels and the cell populations are a noisy mixture of expressed and unexpressed cells. Among mixture models, the gamma mixture model has the strength of being flexible in fitting skewed strictly positive data that occur in many biological measurements. However, the current estimation method uses numerical optimization within the expectation maximization algorithm and is computationally expensive. This makes it infeasible to be applied across many large data sets, as is necessary in mIF data. Powered by a recently developed closed-form estimator for the gamma distribution, we propose a closed-form gamma mixture model that is not only more computationally efficient, but can also incorporate constraints from known biological information to the fitted distribution. We derive the closed-form estimators for the gamma mixture model and use simulations to demonstrate that our model produces comparable results with the current model with significantly less time, and is excellent in constrained model fitting.},

	abstract = {In panel data models and other regressions with unobserved effects, fixed effects estimation is often paired with cluster-robust variance estimation (CRVE) to account for heteroscedasticity and un-modeled dependence among the errors. Although asymptotically consistent, CRVE can be biased downward when the number of clusters is small, leading to hypothesis tests with rejection rates that are too high. More accurate tests can be constructed using bias-reduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE based on a working model, in conjunction with a Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined, and describe how to apply the method when the regression is estimated after absorbing the fixed effects. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. In simulations covering a wide range of scenarios, we find that the conventional cluster-robust Wald test can severely over-reject while the proposed small-sample test maintains Type I error close to nominal levels. The proposed methods are implemented in an R package called clubSandwich. This article has online supplementary materials.},

	abstract = {The thalamus is composed of multiple nuclei densely connected with the cortex in an organized manner, forming parallel thalamocortical networks critical to sensory, motor, and cognitive functioning. Thalamocortical circuit dysfunction has been implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, which also often exhibit sex differences in prevalence, clinical characteristics, and neuropathology. However, very little is known about developmental and sex effects on thalamocortical networks in youth. The present study characterized the effects of age, sex and psychosis symptomatology in anatomically constrained thalamocortical networks in a large community sample of youth (n = 1100, aged 8–21) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Cortical functional connectivity of seven anatomically defined thalamic nuclear groups were examined: anterior, mediodorsal, ventral lateral, ventral posterolateral, pulvinar, medial and lateral geniculate nuclear groups. Age and sex effects were characterized using complementary thalamic region-of-interest (ROI) to cortical ROI and voxel-wise analyses. Effects of clinical symptomatology were analyzed by separating youth into three groups based on their clinical symptoms; typically developing youth (n = 298), psychosis spectrum youth (n = 320), and youth with other psychopathologies (n = 482). As an exploratory analysis, association with PRIME scores were used as a dimensional measure of psychopathology. Age effects were broadly characterized by decreasing connectivity with sensory/motor cortical areas, and increasing connectivity with heteromodal prefrontal and parietal cortical areas. This pattern was most pronounced for thalamic motor and sensory nuclei. Females showed greater connectivity between multiple thalamic nuclear groups and the visual cortex compared to males, while males showed greater connectivity with the inferior frontal and orbitofrontal cortices. Youth with psychosis spectrum symptoms showed a subtle decrease in thalamic connectivity with the premotor and prefrontal cortices. Across all youth, greater PRIME scores were associated with lower connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and mediodorsal thalamus. By characterizing typical development in anatomically constrained thalamocortical networks, this study provides an anchor for conceptualizing disruptions to the integrity of these networks observed in neurodevelopmental disorders.},

Linear mixed effects models demonstrated lower RSA in ASD relative to TD in a base model with no covariates.

	abstract = {Background
Thalamocortical white matter connectivity is disrupted in psychosis and is hypothesized to play a role in its etiology and associated cognitive impairment. Attenuated cognitive symptoms often begin in adolescence, during a critical phase of white matter and cognitive development. However, little is known about the development of thalamocortical white matter connectivity and its association with cognition.
Methods
The present study characterized effects of age, sex, psychosis symptomatology, and cognition in thalamocortical networks in a large sample of youth (n = 1144, aged 8-22 years, 46\% male) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), which included 316 typically-developing youth, 330 psychosis-spectrum youth, and 498 youth with other psychopathology. Probabilistic tractography was used to quantify percent total connectivity between the thalamus and six cortical regions, and assess microstructural properties (i.e. fractional anisotropy-FA) of thalamocortical white matter tracts.
Results
Overall, percent total connectivity of the thalamus was weakly associated with age and was not associated with psychopathology or cognition. In contrast, FA of all thalamocortical tracts increased significantly with age, was generally higher in males than females, and was lowest in psychosis-spectrum youth. FA of tracts linking the thalamus to prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex was related to better cognitive function across subjects.
Conclusions
By characterizing the pattern of typical development and alterations in those at risk for psychotic disorders, this study provides a foundation for further conceptualization of thalamocortical white matter microstructure as a marker of neurodevelopment supporting cognition and an important risk marker for psychosis.},

High co-morbidity suggests dimensional circuit-level abnormalities that cross diagnoses. Here we seek to identify brain-based dimensions of psychopathology using sparse canonical correlation analysis in a sample of 663 youths. This analysis reveals correlated patterns of functional connectivity and psychiatric symptoms. We find that four dimensions of psychopathology – mood, psychosis, fear, and externalizing behavior – are associated (r = 0.68–0.71) with distinct patterns of connectivity. Loss of network segregation between the default mode network and executive networks emerges as a common feature across all dimensions. Connectivity linked to mood and psychosis becomes more prominent with development, and sex differences are present for connectivity related to mood and fear. Critically, findings largely replicate in an independent dataset (n = 336). These results delineate connectivity-guided dimensions of psychopathology that cross clinical diagnostic categories, which could serve as a foundation for developing network-based biomarkers in psychiatry.},

The current study investigates the prevalence of incidental neuroradiologic findings within this population and their relationships with psychiatric conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain MR imaging from 58 individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome was reviewed by board-certified radiologists by using standard clinical procedures. Intracranial incidental findings were classified into 8 categories and compared with a large typically developing cohort.
RESULTS: The rate of incidental findings was significantly higher (P {\textless} .0001) in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome compared with typically developing individuals, driven by a high prevalence of cavum septum pellucidum (19.0\%) and white matter abnormalities (10.3\%). Both of these findings were associated with psychosis in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: Cavum septum pellucidum and white matter hyperintensities are significantly more prevalent in patients with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and may represent biomarkers for psychosis.},

	abstract = {Background
There is increased risk of developing psychosis in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). Although this condition is associated with morphologic brain abnormalities, simultaneous examination of multiple high-resolution measures of cortical structure has not been performed.
Methods
Fifty-three patients with 22q11DS, 30 with psychotic symptoms, were compared with demographically matched nondeleted youths: 53 typically developing and 53 with psychotic symptoms. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging measures of cerebral volume, cortical thickness, surface area, and an index of local gyrification were obtained and compared between groups.
Results
Patients with 22q11DS demonstrated global increases in cortical thickness associated with reductions in surface area, reduced index of local gyrification, and lower cerebral volumes relative to typically developing controls. Findings were principally in the frontal lobe, superior parietal lobes, and in the paramedian cerebral cortex. Focally decreased thickness was seen in the superior temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex in 22q11DS relative to nondeleted groups. Patterns between nondeleted participants with psychotic symptoms and 22q11DS were similar but with important differences in several regions implicated in schizophrenia. Post hoc analysis suggested that like the 22q11DS group, cortical thickness in nondeleted individuals with psychotic symptoms differed from typically developing controls in the superior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, regions previously linked to schizophrenia.
Conclusions
Simultaneous examination of multiple measures of cerebral architecture demonstrates that differences in 22q11DS localize to regions of the frontal, superior parietal, superior temporal, and paramidline cerebral cortex. The overlapping patterns between nondeleted participants with psychotic symptoms and 22q11DS suggest partially shared neuroanatomic substrates.},

	abstract = {Background
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is applied in investigation of brain biomarkers for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the quality of DTI measurements, like other neuroimaging techniques, is susceptible to several confounding factors (e.g., motion, eddy currents), which have only recently come under scrutiny. These confounds are especially relevant in adolescent samples where data quality may be compromised in ways that confound interpretation of maturation parameters. The current study aims to leverage DTI data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), a sample of 1601 youths with ages of 8–21 who underwent neuroimaging, to: 1) establish quality assurance (QA) metrics for the automatic identification of poor DTI image quality; 2) examine the performance of these QA measures in an external validation sample; 3) document the influence of data quality on developmental patterns of typical DTI metrics.
Methods
All diffusion-weighted images were acquired on the same scanner. Visual QA was performed on all subjects completing DTI; images were manually categorized as Poor, Good, or Excellent. Four image quality metrics were automatically computed and used to predict manual QA status: Mean voxel intensity outlier count (MEANVOX), Maximum voxel intensity outlier count (MAXVOX), mean relative motion (MOTION) and temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR). Classification accuracy for each metric was calculated as the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). A threshold was generated for each measure that best differentiated visual QA status and applied in a validation sample. The effects of data quality on sensitivity to expected age effects in this developmental sample were then investigated using the traditional MRI diffusion metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Finally, our method of QA is compared with DTIPrep.
Results
TSNR (AUC=0.94) best differentiated Poor data from Good and Excellent data. MAXVOX (AUC=0.88) best differentiated Good from Excellent DTI data. At the optimal threshold, 88\% of Poor data and 91\% Good/Excellent data were correctly identified. Use of these thresholds on a validation dataset (n=374) indicated high accuracy. In the validation sample 83\% of Poor data and 94\% of Excellent data was identified using thresholds derived from the training sample. Both FA and MD were affected by the inclusion of poor data in an analysis of an age, sex and race matched comparison sample. In addition, we show that the inclusion of poor data results in significant attenuation of the correlation between diffusion metrics (FA and MD) and age during a critical neurodevelopmental period. We find higher correspondence between our QA method and DTIPrep for Poor data, but we find our method to be more robust for apparently high-quality images.
Conclusion
Automated QA of DTI can facilitate large-scale, high-throughput quality assurance by reliably identifying both scanner and subject induced imaging artifacts. The results present a practical example of the confounding effects of artifacts on DTI analysis in a large population-based sample, and suggest that estimates of data quality should not only be reported but also accounted for in data analysis, especially in studies of development.},

	abstract = {Objective:

Disruption of executive function is present in many neuropsychiatric disorders. However, determining the specificity of executive dysfunction across these disorders is challenging given high comorbidity of conditions. Here the authors investigate executive system deficits in association with dimensions of psychiatric symptoms in youth using a working memory paradigm. The authors hypothesize that common and dissociable patterns of dysfunction would be present.

Method:

The authors studied 1,129 youths who completed a fractal n-back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3-T as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Factor scores of clinical psychopathology were calculated using an item-wise confirmatory bifactor model, describing overall psychopathology as well as four orthogonal dimensions of symptoms: anxious-misery (mood and anxiety), behavioral disturbance (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder), psychosis-spectrum symptoms, and fear (phobias). The effect of psychopathology dimensions on behavioral performance and executive system recruitment (2-back {\textgreater} 0-back) was examined using both multivariate (matrix regression) and mass-univariate (linear regression) analyses.

Results:

Overall psychopathology was associated with both abnormal multivariate patterns of activation and a failure to activate executive regions within the cingulo-opercular control network, including the frontal pole, cingulate cortex, and anterior insula. In addition, psychosis-spectrum symptoms were associated with hypoactivation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas behavioral symptoms were associated with hypoactivation of the frontoparietal cortex and cerebellum. In contrast, anxious-misery symptoms were associated with widespread hyperactivation of the executive network.

Conclusions:

These findings provide novel evidence that common and dissociable deficits within the brain’s executive system are present in association with dimensions of psychopathology in youth.},

A subsample of 1601 individuals underwent neuroimaging, including structural magnetic resonance imaging, at an academic and children’s hospital health care network between November 1, 2009, and November 30, 2011.Measures of brain volume derived from T1-weighted structural neuroimaging at 3 T. Analyses were conducted at global, regional, and voxelwise levels. Regional volumes were estimated with an advanced multiatlas regional segmentation procedure, and voxelwise volumetric analyses were conducted as well. Nonlinear developmental patterns were examined using penalized splines within a general additive model. Psychosis spectrum (PS) symptom severity was summarized using factor analysis and evaluated dimensionally.Following exclusions due to comorbidity and image quality assurance, the final sample included 791 participants aged youth 8 to 22 years. Fifty percent (n = 393) were female. After structured interviews, 391 participants were identified as having PS features (PS group) and 400 participants were identified as typically developing comparison individuals without significant psychopathology (TD group). Compared with the TD group, the PS group had diminished whole-brain gray matter volume (P = 3.4 × 10−4) when not accounting for intracranial volume and relatively expanded white matter volume when accounting for intracranial volume (P = 2.2 × 10−3). Voxelwise analyses revealed significantly lower gray matter volume in the medial temporal lobe (maximum z score = 5.2 and cluster size of 1225 for the right and maximum z score = 4.5 and cluster size of 310 for the left) as well as in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex. Volumetric reduction in the medial temporal lobe was correlated with PS symptom severity.Structural brain abnormalities that have been commonly reported in adults with psychosis are present early in life in youth with PS symptoms and are not due to medication effects. Future longitudinal studies could use the presence of such abnormalities in conjunction with clinical presentation, cognitive profile, and genomics to predict risk and aid in stratification to guide early interventions.},

A dimensional conceptualization of depression suggests that symptoms should be associated with a continuum of deficits in specific neural circuits. However, most prior investigations of abnormalities in functional connectivity have typically focused on a single diagnostic category using hypothesis-driven seed-based analyses. Here, using a sample of 105 adult female participants from three diagnostic groups (healthy controls, n=17; major depression, n=38; and post-traumatic stress disorder, n=50), we examine the dimensional relationship between resting-state functional dysconnectivity and severity of depressive symptoms across diagnostic categories using a data-driven analysis (multivariate distance-based matrix regression). This connectome-wide analysis identified foci of dysconnectivity associated with depression severity in the bilateral amygdala. Follow-up seed analyses using subject-specific amygdala segmentations revealed that depression severity was associated with amygdalo-frontal hypo-connectivity in a network of regions including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and anterior insula. In contrast, anxiety was associated with elevated connectivity between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Taken together, these results emphasize the centrality of the amygdala in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms, and suggest that dissociable patterns of amygdalo-frontal dysconnectivity are a critical neurobiological feature across clinical diagnostic categories.},

	abstract = {Background
Adolescence is a critical period for emotional maturation and is a time when clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression increase, particularly in females. However, few studies relate developmental differences in symptoms of anxiety and depression to brain development. Cerebral blood flow is one brain phenotype that is known to have marked developmental sex differences.
Methods
We investigated whether developmental sex differences in cerebral blood flow mediated sex differences in anxiety and depression symptoms by capitalizing on a large sample of 875 youths who completed cross-sectional imaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Perfusion was quantified on a voxelwise basis using arterial spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging at 3T. Perfusion images were related to trait and state anxiety using general additive models with penalized splines, while controlling for gray matter density on a voxelwise basis. Clusters found to be related to anxiety were evaluated for interactions with age, sex, and puberty.
Results
Trait anxiety was associated with elevated perfusion in a network of regions including the amygdala, anterior insula, and fusiform cortex, even after accounting for prescan state anxiety. Notably, these relationships strengthened with age and the transition through puberty. Moreover, higher trait anxiety in postpubertal females was mediated by elevated perfusion of the left amygdala.
Conclusions
Taken together, these results demonstrate that differences in the evolution of cerebral perfusion during adolescence may be a critical element of the affective neurobiological characteristics underlying sex differences in anxiety and mood symptoms.},

	abstract = {In the fields of neuroimaging and genetics, a key goal is testing the association of a single outcome with a very high-dimensional imaging or genetic variable. Often, summary measures of the high-dimensional variable are created to sequentially test and localize the association with the outcome. In some cases, the associations between the outcome and summary measures are significant, but subsequent tests used to localize differences are underpowered and do not identify regions associated with the outcome. Here, we propose a generalization of Rao’s score test based on projecting the score statistic onto a linear subspace of a high-dimensional parameter space. The approach provides a way to localize signal in the high-dimensional space by projecting the scores to the subspace where the score test was performed. This allows for inference in the high-dimensional space to be performed on the same degrees of freedom as the score test, effectively reducing the number of comparisons. Simulation results demonstrate the test has competitive power relative to others commonly used. We illustrate the method by analyzing a subset of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Results suggest cortical thinning of the frontal and temporal lobes may be a useful biological marker of Alzheimer’s disease risk. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {Spatial extent inference (SEI) is widely used across neuroimaging modalities to adjust for multiple comparisons when studying brain-phenotype associations that inform our understanding of disease. Recent studies have shown that Gaussian random field (GRF)-based tools can have inflated family-wise error rates (FWERs). This has led to substantial controversy as to which processing choices are necessary to control the FWER using GRF-based SEI. The failure of GRF-based methods is due to unrealistic assumptions about the spatial covariance function of the imaging data. A permutation procedure is the most robust SEI tool because it estimates the spatial covariance function from the imaging data. However, the permutation procedure can fail because its assumption of exchangeability is violated in many imaging modalities. Here, we propose the (semi-) parametric bootstrap joint (PBJ; sPBJ) testing procedures that are designed for SEI of multilevel imaging data. The sPBJ procedure uses a robust estimate of the spatial covariance function, which yields consistent estimates of standard errors, even if the covariance model is misspecified. We use the methods to study the association between performance and executive functioning in a working memory functional magnetic resonance imaging study. The sPBJ has similar or greater power to the PBJ and permutation procedures while maintaining the nominal type 1 error rate in reasonable sample sizes. We provide an R package to perform inference using the PBJ and sPBJ procedures.},

Racial differences in GBS disease rates have been previously documented, with Black infants having higher rates of EOGBS and LOGBS, but it is not known if these have persisted. Therefore, we sought to determine the differences in EOGBS and LOGBS disease by race over the past decade in Tennessee.This study used active population-based and laboratory-based surveillance data for invasive GBS disease conducted through Active Bacterial Core surveillance in selected counties across Tennessee. We included infants younger than 90 days and who had invasive GBS disease between 2009 and 2018.A total of 356 GBS cases were included, with 60\% having LOGBS. EOGBS and LOGBS had decreasing temporal trends over the study period. Overall, there were no changes in temporal trend noted in the rates of EOGBS and LOGBS among White infants. However, Black infants had significantly decreasing EOGBS and LOGBS temporal trends (relative risk [95\% confidence interval], .87 [.79, .96] [P = .007] and .90 [.84–.97] [P = .003], respectively).Years after the successful implementation of the universal screening guidelines, our data revealed an overall decrease in LOGBS rates, primarily driven by changes among Black infants. More studies are needed to characterize the racial disparities in GBS rates, and factors driving them. Prevention measures such as vaccination are needed to have a further impact on disease rates.},

	abstract = {Many key findings in neuroimaging studies involve similarities between brain maps, but statistical methods used to measure these findings have varied. Current state-of-the-art methods involve comparing observed group-level brain maps (after averaging intensities at each image location across multiple subjects) against spatial null models of these group-level maps. However, these methods typically make strong and potentially unrealistic statistical assumptions, such as covariance stationarity. To address these issues, in this article we propose using subject-level data and a classical permutation testing framework to test and assess similarities between brain maps. Our method is comparable to traditional permutation tests in that it involves randomly permuting subjects to generate a null distribution of intermodal correspondence statistics, which we compare to an observed statistic to estimate a p-value. We apply and compare our method in simulated and real neuroimaging data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. We show that our method performs well for detecting relationships between modalities known to be strongly related (cortical thickness and sulcal depth), and it is conservative when an association would not be expected (cortical thickness and activation on the n-back working memory task). Notably, our method is the most flexible and reliable for localizing intermodal relationships within subregions of the brain and allows for generalizable statistical inference.},

Advanced age is a known risk factor for development of delirium. However, the association between age and catatonia has not been described. We aim to describe the occurrence of catatonia, delirium, and coma by age group in a critically ill, adult population.Design: Convenience cohort, nested within two clinical trials and two observational cohort studies.Setting: Intensive care units in an academic medical center in Nashville, TN.Patients: 378 critically ill adult patients on mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors.Measurements and Main Results: Patients were assessed for catatonia, delirium, and coma by independent and blinded personnel, the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale, the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale. Of 378 patients, 23\% met diagnostic criteria for catatonia, 66\% experienced delirium, and 52\% experienced coma during the period of observation. There was no relationship found between age and catatonia severity or age and presence of specific catatonia items. The prevalence of catatonia was strongly associated with age in the setting of critical illness (p {\textless} 0.05). Delirium and comas' association with age was limited to the setting of catatonia.Conclusion: Given the significant relationship between age and catatonia independent of coma and delirium status, these data demonstrate catatonia's association with advanced age in the setting of critical illness. Future studies can explore the causative factors for this association and further elucidate the risk factors for acute brain dysfunction across the age spectrum.},

We assume that the exposure directly influences a group of latent, or unmeasured, factors which are associated with both the outcome and a subset of the biomarkers. The biomarkers associated with the latent factors linking the exposure to the outcome are considered “mediators.” We derive the likelihood for this model and develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to maximize an L1-penalized version of this likelihood to limit the number of factors and associated biomarkers. We show that the resulting estimates are consistent and that the estimates of the nonzero parameters have an asymptotically normal distribution. In simulations, procedures based on this new model can have significantly higher power for detecting the mediating biomarkers compared with the simpler approaches. We apply our method to a study that evaluates the relationship between body mass index, 481 metabolic measurements, and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.},

An existing approach incorporated the principal component analysis (PCA) to address this challenge based on the fact that the transformed mediators are conditionally independent given the orthogonality of the principal components (PCs). However, the transformed mediator PCs, which are linear combinations of original mediators, can be difficult to interpret. A sparse high-dimensional mediation analysis approach is proposed which adopts the sparse PCA method to the mediation setting.

	abstract = {With multiple possible mediators on the causal pathway from a treatment to an outcome, we consider the problem of decomposing the effects along multiple possible causal path(s) through each distinct mediator. Under a path-specific effects framework, such fine-grained decompositions necessitate stringent assumptions, such as correctly specifying the causal structure among the mediators, and no unobserved confounding among the mediators. In contrast, interventional direct and indirect effects for multiple mediators can be identified under much weaker conditions, while providing scientifically relevant causal interpretations. Nonetheless, current estimation approaches require (correctly) specifying a model for the joint mediator distribution, which can be difficult when there is a high-dimensional set of possibly continuous and noncontinuous mediators. In this article, we avoid the need to model this distribution, by developing a definition of interventional effects previously suggested for longitudinal mediation. We propose a novel estimation strategy that uses nonparametric estimates of the (counterfactual) mediator distributions. Noncontinuous outcomes can be accommodated using nonlinear outcome models. Estimation proceeds via Monte Carlo integration. The procedure is illustrated using publicly available genomic data to assess the causal effect of a microRNA expression on the 3-month mortality of brain cancer patients that is potentially mediated by expression values of multiple genes.},

RESULTS: We implement and compare data transformations and normalization algorithms in multiplexed imaging data. Our methods adapt the ComBat and functional data registration methods to remove slide effects in this domain, and we present an evaluation framework to compare the proposed approaches. We present clear slide-to-slide variation in the raw, unadjusted data, and show that many of the proposed normalization methods reduce this variation while preserving and improving the biological signal. Further, we find that dividing multiplexed imaging data by its slide mean, and the functional data registration methods, perform the best under our proposed evaluation framework. In summary, this approach provides a foundation for better data quality and evaluation criteria in multiplexed imaging.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antiviral treatment is recommended for all hospitalized children with suspected or confirmed influenza, regardless of their risk profile. Few data exist on adherence to these recommendations, so we sought to determine factors associated with influenza testing and antiviral treatment in children.
METHODS: Hospitalized children {\textless}18 years of age with acute respiratory illness (ARI) were enrolled through active surveillance at pediatric medical centers in seven cities between 11/1/2015 and 6/30/2016; clinical information was obtained from parent interview and chart review. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to identify factors associated with influenza testing and antiviral treatment.
RESULTS: Of the 2299 hospitalized children with ARI enrolled during one influenza season, 51\% (n = 1183) were tested clinically for influenza. Clinicians provided antiviral treatment for 61 of 117 (52\%) patients with a positive influenza test versus 66 of 1066 (6\%) with a negative or unknown test result. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with testing included neuromuscular disease (aOR = 5.35, 95\% CI [3.58-8.01]), immunocompromised status (aOR = 2.88, 95\% CI [1.66-5.01]), age (aOR = 0.93, 95\% CI [0.91-0.96]), private only versus public only insurance (aOR = 0.78, 95\% CI [0.63-0.98]), and chronic lung disease (aOR = 0.64, 95\% CI [0.51-0.81]). Factors associated with antiviral treatment included neuromuscular disease (aOR = 1.86, 95\% CI [1.04, 3.31]), immunocompromised state (aOR = 2.63, 95\% CI [1.38, 4.99]), duration of illness (aOR = 0.92, 95\% CI [0.84, 0.99]), and chronic lung disease (aOR = 0.60, 95\% CI [0.38, 0.95]).
CONCLUSION: Approximately half of children hospitalized with influenza during the 2015-2016 influenza season were treated with antivirals. Because antiviral treatment for influenza is associated with better health outcomes, further studies of subsequent seasons would help evaluate current use of antivirals among children and better understand barriers for treatment.},

Generally, mIF data is used to examine the abundance of immune cells in the TIME; however, this does not capture spatial patterns of immune cells throughout the TIME, a metric increasingly recognized as important for prognosis. To address this gap, we developed an R package spatialTIME that enables spatial analysis of mIF data, as well as the iTIME web application that provides a robust but simplified user interface for describing both abundance and spatial architecture of the TIME. The spatialTIME package calculates univariate and bivariate spatial statistics (e.g. Ripley’s K, Besag’s L, Macron’s M and G or nearest neighbor distance) and creates publication quality plots for spatial organization of the cells in each tissue sample. The iTIME web application allows users to statistically compare the abundance measures with patient clinical features along with visualization of the TIME for one tissue sample at a time.spatialTIME is implemented in R and can be downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/FridleyLab/spatialTIME) or CRAN. An extensive vignette for using spatialTIME can also be found at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatialTIME/index.html. iTIME is implemented within a R Shiny application and can be accessed online (http://itime.moffitt.org/), with code available on GitHub (https://github.com/FridleyLab/iTIME).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Quantitative immunofluorescence is often used for immunohistochemistry quantification of proteins that serve as cancer biomarkers. Advanced image analysis systems for pathology allow capturing expression levels in each individual cell or subcellular compartment. However, only the mean signal intensity within the cancer tissue region of interest is usually considered as biomarker completely ignoring the issue of tumor heterogeneity.We propose using immunohistochemistry image-derived information on the spatial distribution of cellular signal intensity (CSI) of protein expression within the cancer cell population to quantify both mean expression level and tumor heterogeneity of CSI levels. We view CSI levels as marks in a marked point process of cancer cells in the tissue and define spatial indices based on conditional mean and conditional variance of the marked point process. The proposed methodology provides objective metrics of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in protein expressions that allow discriminating between different patterns of heterogeneity. The prognostic utility of new spatial indices is investigated and compared to the standard mean signal intensity biomarkers using the protein expressions in tissue microarrays incorporating tumor tissues from 1000+ breast cancer patients. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {The threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) approach integrates cluster information into voxel-wise statistical inference to enhance detectability of neuroimaging signal. Despite the significantly increased sensitivity, the application of TFCE is limited by several factors: (i) generalisation to data structures, like brain network connectivity data is not trivial, (ii) TFCE values are in an arbitrary unit, therefore, P-values can only be obtained by a computationally demanding permutation-test. Here, we introduce a probabilistic approach for TFCE (pTFCE), that gives a simple general framework for topology-based belief boosting. The core of pTFCE is a conditional probability, calculated based on Bayes' rule, from the probability of voxel intensity and the threshold-wise likelihood function of the measured cluster size. In this paper, we provide an estimation of these distributions based on Gaussian Random Field theory. The conditional probabilities are then aggregated across cluster-forming thresholds by a novel incremental aggregation method. pTFCE is validated on simulated and real fMRI data. The results suggest that pTFCE is more robust to various ground truth shapes and provides a stricter control over cluster “leaking” than TFCE and, in many realistic cases, further improves its sensitivity. Correction for multiple comparisons can be trivially performed on the enhanced P-values, without the need for permutation testing, thus pTFCE is well-suitable for the improvement of statistical inference in any neuroimaging workflow. Implementation of pTFCE is available at https://spisakt.github.io/pTFCE.},

Recent technological advances in next-generation sequencing- and imaging-based approaches have established the power of spatial transcriptomics to measure expression levels of all or most genes systematically throughout tissue space, and have been adopted to generate biological insights in neuroscience, development and plant biology as well as to investigate a range of disease contexts, including cancer. Similar to datasets made possible by genomic sequencing and population health surveys, the large-scale atlases generated by this technology lend themselves to exploratory data analysis for hypothesis generation. Here we review spatial transcriptomic technologies and describe the repertoire of operations available for paths of analysis of the resulting data. Spatial transcriptomics can also be deployed for hypothesis testing using experimental designs that compare time points or conditions—including genetic or environmental perturbations. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data are naturally amenable to integration with other data modalities, providing an expandable framework for insight into tissue organization.},

In the early stage of the illness, hyperactivity is present in the anterior hippocampus and is thought to spread to other regions as the illness progresses. However, there is limited evidence for changes in basal hippocampal function following the onset of psychosis. Resting state functional MRI signal amplitude may be a proxy measure for increased metabolism and disrupted oscillatory activity, both consequences of an excitation/inhibition imbalance underlying hippocampal hyperactivity. Here, we used fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) to test the hypothesis of progressive hippocampal hyperactivity in a two-year longitudinal case-control study. We found higher fALFF in the anterior and posterior hippocampus of individuals in the early stage of non-affective psychosis at study entry. Contrary to our hypothesis of progressive hippocampal dysfunction, we found evidence for normalization of fALFF over time in psychosis. Our findings support a model in which hippocampal fALFF is a marker of psychosis vulnerability or acute illness state rather than an enduring feature of the illness.},

We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size.

The purposes of this study were to (a) determine the frequencies with which different effect sizes were reported in published, peer-reviewed articles in health education, promotion, and behavior journals and (b) discuss implications for reporting effect size in social science research. Across a 4-year time period (2010-2013), 1,950 peer-reviewed published articles were examined from the following six health education and behavior journals: American Journal of Health Behavior, American Journal of Health Promotion, Health Education \& Behavior, Health Education Research, Journal of American College Health, and Journal of School Health Quantitative features from eligible manuscripts were documented using Qualtrics online survey software. Of the 1,245 articles in the final sample that reported quantitative data analyses, approximately 47.9\% (n = 597) of the articles reported an effect size. While 16 unique types of effect size were reported across all included journals, many of the effect sizes were reported with little frequency across most journals. Overall, odds ratio/adjusted odds ratio (n = 340, 50.1\%), Pearson r/r(2) (n = 162, 23.8\%), and eta squared/partial eta squared (n = 46, 7.2\%) accounted for the most frequently used effect size.

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a multifaceted neuropsychiatric disorder. Its onset is the result of complex interactions between genetic, developmental and environmental factors. It almost certainly presents a heterogeneous group of aetiologies which may not be reflected in the symptomatic/clinical presentation of patients. Therefore, a better molecular understanding of the disease onset and progression is urgently needed. The high complexity of the disorder and the heterogeneity of patient populations account for the slow progress of biomarker discovery approaches. Multi-omics profiling approaches can be employed to investigate large numbers of patient and control samples in a single experiment. These large scale experiments are required to identify disease intrinsic molecular signatures as well as patient subgroups with potentially distinct biochemical pathways underpinning their symptoms. In this overview, we describe some of the most important challenges for biomarker discovery for psychiatric disorders and emphasize how these problems contribute to the requirement of large sample numbers. Results of MS-based protein profiling studies in schizophrenia research are reviewed and technical advantages and difficulties of the methodologies described. We outline recent technological advances that generated impressive results in other areas of research and point to their applicability for biomarker discovery in psychiatric disorders.},

Therefore, conceptual tools and their translation to computational tools in the package sandwich are discussed, enabling the computation of sandwich estimators in general parametric models. Object orientation can be achieved by providing a few extractor functions' most importantly for the empirical estimating functions' from which various types of sandwich estimators can be computed.},

	abstract = {Significance: Resting-state functional connectivity imaging in mice with optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging could provide a powerful translational tool for developing imaging biomarkers in preclinical disease models. However, statistical interpretation of correlation coefficients is hampered by autocorrelations in the data. Aim: We sought to better understand temporal and spatial autocorrelations in optical resting-state data. We then adapted statistical methods from functional magnetic resonance imaging to improve statistical inference. Approach: Resting-state data were obtained from mice using a custom-built OSI system. The autocorrelation time was calculated at each pixel, and z scores for correlation coefficients were calculated using Fisher transforms and variance derived from either Bartlett’s method or xDF. The significance of each correlation coefficient was determined through control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Results: Autocorrelation was generally even across the cortex and parcellation reduced variance. Correcting variance with Bartlett’s method resulted in a uniform reduction in z scores, with xDF preserving high z scores for highly correlated data. Control of the FDR resulted in reasonable thresholding of the correlation coefficient matrices. The use of Bartlett’s method compared with xDF results in more conservative thresholding and fewer false positives under null hypothesis conditions. Conclusions: We developed streamlined methods for control of autocorrelation in OIS functional connectivity data in mice, and Bartlett’s method is a reasonable compromise and simplification that allows for accurate autocorrelation correction. These results improve the rigor and reproducibility of functional neuroimaging in mice.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease in which the degree of cortical atrophy in specific structures of the brain serves as a useful imaging biomarker. Recent approaches using linear mixed effects (LME) models in longitudinal neuroimaging have been powerful and flexible in investigating the temporal trajectories of cortical thickness. However, massive-univariate analysis, a simplified approach that obtains a summary statistic (e.g., a p-value) for every vertex along the cortex, is insufficient to model cortical atrophy because it does not account for spatial similarities of the signals in neighboring locations. In this article, we develop a permutation-based inference procedure to detect spatial clusters of vertices showing statistically significant differences in the rates of cortical atrophy. The proposed method, called SpLoc, uses spatial information to combine the signals adaptively across neighboring vertices, yielding high statistical power while controlling family-wise error rate (FWER) accurately. When we reject the global null hypothesis, we use a cluster selection algorithm to detect the spatial clusters of significant vertices. We validate our method using simulation studies and apply it to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to show its superior performance over existing methods. An R package for implementing SpLoc is publicly available.},

Specifically, we establish conditions under which the distribution of the maximum is approximated by that of the maximum of a sum of the Gaussian random vectors with the same covariance matrices as the original vectors. This result applies when the dimension of random vectors (\$p\$) is large compared to the sample size (\$n\$); in fact, \$p\$ can be much larger than \$n\$, without restricting correlations of the coordinates of these vectors. We also show that the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the random vectors with unknown covariance matrices can be consistently estimated by the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the conditional Gaussian random vectors obtained by multiplying the original vectors with i.i.d. Gaussian multipliers. This is the Gaussian multiplier (or wild) bootstrap procedure. Here too, \$p\$ can be large or even much larger than \$n\$. These distributional approximations, either Gaussian or conditional Gaussian, yield a high-quality approximation to the distribution of the original maximum, often with approximation error decreasing polynomially in the sample size, and hence are of interest in many applications. We demonstrate how our Gaussian approximations and the multiplier bootstrap can be used for modern high-dimensional estimation, multiple hypothesis testing, and adaptive specification testing. All these results contain nonasymptotic bounds on approximation errors.},

To evaluate differences, it is critical to have a ground truth dataset that is representative of the assay.A new immunoFLuorescence Image NOrmalization method is presented and evaluated against alternative methods and workflows. Multiround immunofluorescence staining of the same tissue with the nuclear dye DAPI was used to represent virtual slides and a ground truth. DAPI was restained on a given tissue slide producing multiple images of the same underlying structure but undergoing multiple representative tissue handling steps. This ground truth dataset was used to evaluate and compare multiple normalization methods including median, quantile, smooth quantile, median ratio normalization and trimmed mean of the M-values. These methods were applied in both an unbiased grid object and segmented cell object workflow to 24 multiplexed biomarkers. An upper quartile normalization of grid objects in log space was found to obtain almost equivalent performance to directly normalizing segmented cell objects by the middle quantile. The developed grid-based technique was then applied with on-slide controls for evaluation. Using five or fewer controls per slide can introduce biases into the data. Ten or more on-slide controls were able to robustly correct for batch effects.The data underlying this article along with the FLINO R-scripts used to perform the evaluation of image normalizations methods and workflows can be downloaded from https://github.com/GE-Bio/FLINO.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Software applying machine learning has become an essential tool to automate analysis, but these methods require annotated examples to learn from. Efficiently exploring large datasets to find relevant examples remains a challenging bottleneck. Here, we present Advanced Cell Classifier (ACC), a graphical software package for phenotypic analysis that addresses these difficulties. ACC applies machine-learning and image-analysis methods to high-content data generated by large-scale, cell-based experiments. It features methods to mine microscopic image data, discover new phenotypes, and improve recognition performance. We demonstrate that these features substantially expedite the training process, successfully uncover rare phenotypes, and improve the accuracy of the analysis. ACC is extensively documented, designed to be user-friendly for researchers without machine-learning expertise, and distributed as a free open-source tool at www.cellclassifier.org.},

	abstract = {Advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing technology have resulted in a wealth of studies aiming to identify transcriptomic cell types in various biological systems. There are multiple experimental approaches to isolate and profile single cells, which provide different levels of cellular and tissue coverage. In addition, multiple computational strategies have been proposed to identify putative cell types from single-cell data. From a data generation perspective, recent single-cell studies can be classified into two groups: those that distribute reads shallowly over large numbers of cells and those that distribute reads more deeply over a smaller cell population. Although there are advantages to both approaches in terms of cellular and tissue coverage, it is unclear whether different computational cell type identification methods are better suited to one or the other experimental paradigm. This study reviews three cell type clustering algorithms, each representing one of three broad approaches, and finds that PCA-based algorithms appear most suited to low read depth data sets, whereas gene clustering-based and biclustering algorithms perform better on high read depth data sets. In addition, highly related cell classes are better distinguished by higher-depth data, given the same total number of reads; however, simultaneous discovery of distinct and similar types is better served by lower-depth, higher cell number data. Overall, this study suggests that the depth of profiling should be determined by initial assumptions about the diversity of cells in the population, and that the selection of clustering algorithm(s) subsequently based on the depth of profiling will allow for better identification of putative transcriptomic cell types.},

	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

RESULTS: We introduce a highly scalable graph-based clustering algorithm PARC-Phenotyping by Accelerated Refined Community-partitioning-for large-scale, high-dimensional single-cell data ({\textgreater}1 million cells). Using large single-cell flow and mass cytometry, RNA-seq and imaging-based biophysical data, we demonstrate that PARC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art clustering algorithms without subsampling of cells, including Phenograph, FlowSOM and Flock, in terms of both speed and ability to robustly detect rare cell populations. For example, PARC can cluster a single-cell dataset of 1.1 million cells within 13 min, compared with {\textgreater}2 h for the next fastest graph-clustering algorithm. Our work presents a scalable algorithm to cope with increasingly large-scale single-cell analysis.

	abstract = {Multiplexed imaging technologies enable the study of biological tissues at single-cell resolution while preserving spatial information. Currently, high-dimension imaging data analysis is technology-specific and requires multiple tools, restricting analytical scalability and result reproducibility. Here we present SIMPLI (Single-cell Identification from MultiPLexed Images), a flexible and technology-agnostic software that unifies all steps of multiplexed imaging data analysis. After raw image processing, SIMPLI performs a spatially resolved, single-cell analysis of the tissue slide as well as cell-independent quantifications of marker expression to investigate features undetectable at the cell level. SIMPLI is highly customisable and can run on desktop computers as well as high-performance computing environments, enabling workflow parallelisation for large datasets. SIMPLI produces multiple tabular and graphical outputs at each step of the analysis. Its containerised implementation and minimum configuration requirements make SIMPLI a portable and reproducible solution for multiplexed imaging data analysis. Software is available at “SIMPLI [https://github.com/ciccalab/SIMPLI]”.},

	abstract = {Facetto is a scalable visual analytics application that is used to discover single-cell phenotypes in high-dimensional multi-channel microscopy images of human tumors and tissues. Such images represent the cutting edge of digital histology and promise to revolutionize how diseases such as cancer are studied, diagnosed, and treated. Highly multiplexed tissue images are complex, comprising 109 or more pixels, 60-plus channels, and millions of individual cells. This makes manual analysis challenging and error-prone. Existing automated approaches are also inadequate, in large part, because they are unable to effectively exploit the deep knowledge of human tissue biology available to anatomic pathologists. To overcome these challenges, Facetto enables a semi-automated analysis of cell types and states. It integrates unsupervised and supervised learning into the image and feature exploration process and offers tools for analytical provenance. Experts can cluster the data to discover new types of cancer and immune cells and use clustering results to train a convolutional neural network that classifies new cells accordingly. Likewise, the output of classifiers can be clustered to discover aggregate patterns and phenotype subsets. We also introduce a new hierarchical approach to keep track of analysis steps and data subsets created by users; this assists in the identification of cell types. Users can build phenotype trees and interact with the resulting hierarchical structures of both high-dimensional feature and image spaces. We report on use-cases in which domain scientists explore various large-scale fluorescence imaging datasets. We demonstrate how Facetto assists users in steering the clustering and classification process, inspecting analysis results, and gaining new scientific insights into cancer biology.},

Recently, image-based profiling has shown promise as a means for broadly characterizing molecules’ effects on cells in several drug-discovery applications, including target-agnostic screening and predicting a compound’s mechanism of action (MOA). Several profiling methods have been proposed, but little is known about their comparative performance, impeding the wider adoption and further development of image-based profiling. We compared these methods by applying them to a widely applicable assay of cultured cells and measuring the ability of each method to predict the MOA of a compendium of drugs. A very simple method that is based on population means performed as well as methods designed to take advantage of the measurements of individual cells. This is surprising because many treatments induced a heterogeneous phenotypic response across the cell population in each sample. Another simple method, which performs factor analysis on the cellular measurements before averaging them, provided substantial improvement and was able to predict MOA correctly for 94\% of the treatments in our ground-truth set. To facilitate the ready application and future development of image-based phenotypic profiling methods, we provide our complete ground-truth and test data sets, as well as open-source implementations of the various methods in a common software framework.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-016-0895-y},
	abstract = {Background: Automated classification using machine learning often relies on features derived from segmenting individual objects, which can be difficult to automate. WND-CHARM is a previously developed classification algorithm in which features are computed on the whole image, thereby avoiding the need for segmentation. The algorithm obtained encouraging results but requires considerable computational expertise to execute. Furthermore, some benchmark sets have been shown to be subject to confounding artifacts that overestimate classification accuracy. Results: We developed CP-CHARM, a user-friendly image-based classification algorithm inspired by WND-CHARM in (i) its ability to capture a wide variety of morphological aspects of the image, and (ii) the absence of requirement for segmentation. In order to make such an image-based classification method easily accessible to the biological research community, CP-CHARM relies on the widely-used open-source image analysis software CellProfiler for feature extraction. To validate our method, we reproduced WND-CHARM's results and ensured that CP-CHARM obtained comparable performance. We then successfully applied our approach on cell-based assay data and on tissue images. We designed these new training and test sets to reduce the effect of batch-related artifacts. Conclusions: The proposed method preserves the strengths of WND-CHARM - it extracts a wide variety of morphological features directly on whole images thereby avoiding the need for cell segmentation, but additionally, it makes the methods easily accessible for researchers without computational expertise by implementing them as a CellProfiler pipeline. It has been demonstrated to perform well on a wide range of bioimage classification problems, including on new datasets that have been carefully selected and annotated to minimize batch effects. This provides for the first time a realistic and reliable assessment of the whole image classification strategy. © 2016 Uhlmann et al.},

As a result, higher-order patterns of tissue organization are poorly understood and not systematically connected to disease pathology or clinical outcomes. To address this gap, we developed UTAG, a novel method to identify and quantify microanatomical tissue structures in multiplexed images without human intervention. Our method combines information on cellular phenotypes with the physical proximity of cells to accurately identify organ-specific microanatomical domains in healthy and diseased tissue. We apply our method to various types of images across physiological and disease states to show that it can consistently detect higher level architectures in human organs, quantify structural differences between healthy and diseased tissue, and reveal tissue organization patterns with relevance to clinical outcomes in cancer patients.},

	abstract = {study of mapping and interaction of co-localized proteins at a sub-cellular level is important for understanding complex biological phenomena. One of the recent techniques to map co-localized proteins is to use the standard immuno-fluorescence microscopy in a cyclic manner (Nat Biotechnol 24:1270–8, 2006; Proc Natl Acad Sci 110:11982–7, 2013). Unfortunately, these techniques suffer from variability in intensity and positioning of signals from protein markers within a run and across different runs. Therefore, it is necessary to standardize protocols for preprocessing of the multiplexed bioimaging (MBI) data from multiple runs to a comparable scale before any further analysis can be performed on the data. In this paper, we compare various normalization protocols and propose on the basis of the obtained results, a robust normalization technique that produces consistent results on the MBI data collected from different runs using the Toponome Imaging System (TIS). Normalization results produced by the proposed method on a sample TIS data set for colorectal cancer patients were ranked favorably by two pathologists and two biologists. We show that the proposed method produces higher between class Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and lower within class KL divergence on a distribution of cell phenotypes from colorectal cancer and histologically normal samples.},

It is therefore critical to effectively address batch effects in genomic data to overcome these challenges. Many existing methods for batch effects adjustment assume the data follow a continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian distribution. However in RNA-seq studies the data are typically skewed, over-dispersed counts, so this assumption is not appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial regression models have been used previously to better capture the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction method, ComBat-seq, using a negative binomial regression model that retains the integer nature of count data in RNA-seq studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common differential expression software packages that require integer counts. We show in realistic simulations that the ComBat-seq adjusted data results in better statistical power and control of false positives in differential expression compared to data adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated in a real data example that ComBat-seq successfully removes batch effects and recovers the biological signal in the data.},

	abstract = {New technologies, such as multiplex immunofluorescence microscopy (mIF), are being developed and used for the assessment and visualization of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). These assays produce not only an estimate of the abundance of immune cells in the TIME, but also their spatial locations; however, there are currently few approaches to analyze the spatial context of the TIME. Thus, we have developed a framework for the spatial analysis of the TIME using Ripley’s K, coupled with a permutation-based framework to estimate and measure the departure from complete spatial randomness (CSR) as a measure of the interactions between immune cells. This approach was then applied to ovarian cancer using mIF collected on intra-tumoral regions of interest (ROIs) and tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 158 high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients in the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) (94 subjects on TMAs resulting in 259 tissue cores; 91 subjects with 254 ROIs). Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the association of abundance and spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, cytotoxic T-cells, and regulatory T-cells, and overall survival. We found that EOC patients with high abundance and low spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and cytotoxic T-cells in their tumors had the best overall survival. In contrast, patients with low levels of regulatory T-cells but with a high level of spatial clustering (compare to those with a low level of spatial clustering) had better survival. These findings underscore the prognostic importance of evaluating not only immune cell abundance but also the spatial contexture of the immune cells in the TIME. In conclusion, the application of this spatial analysis framework to the study of the TIME could lead to the identification of immune content and spatial architecture that could aid in the determination of patients that are likely to respond to immunotherapies.},

The power of multiplexing combined with spatial information and quantification was recently illustrated on breast cancer tissue and was described as next-generation IHC. Robust, accurate, and high-throughput cell segmentation is crucial for the analysis of this new generation of IHC data. To this end, we propose a watershed-based cell segmentation, which uses a nuclear marker and multiple membrane markers, the latter automatically selected based on their correlation. In comparison with the state-of-the-art segmentation pipelines, which are only using a single marker for object detection, we could show that the use of multiple markers can significantly increase the segmentation power, and thus, multiplexed information should be used and not ignored during the segmentation. Furthermore, we provide a novel, user-friendly open-source toolbox for the automatic segmentation of multiplexed histopathological images. © 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

It covers classical likelihood, Bayesian, and permutation inference; an introduction to basic asymptotic distribution theory; and modern topics like M-estimation, the jackknife, and the bootstrap. R code is woven throughout the text, and there are a large number of examples and problems.An important goal has been to make the topics accessible to a wide audience, with little overt reliance on measure theory. A typical semester course consists of Chapters 1-6 (likelihood-based estimation and testing, Bayesian inference, basic asymptotic results) plus selections from M-estimation and related testing and resampling methodology.Dennis Boos and Len Stefanski are professors in the Department of Statistics at North Carolina State. Their research has been eclectic, often with a robustness angle, although Stefanski is also known for research concentrated on measurement error, including a co-authored book on non-linear measurement error models. In recent years the authors have jointly worked on variable selection methods. ​},

In the present work, we take on various critiques of our work and further explore the limitations of our original work. We address issues about the particular event-related designs we used, considering multiple event types and randomisation of events between subjects. We consider the lack of validity found with one-sample permutation (sign flipping) tests, investigating a number of approaches to improve the false positive control of this widely used procedure. We found that the combination of a two-sided test and cleaning the data using ICA FIX resulted in nominal false positive rates for all datasets, meaning that data cleaning is not only important for resting state fMRI, but also for task fMRI. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work on the fMRI literature as a whole, estimating that at least 10\% of the fMRI studies have used the most problematic cluster inference method (P = 0.01 cluster defining threshold), and how individual studies can be interpreted in light of our findings. These additional results underscore our original conclusions, on the importance of data sharing and thorough evaluation of statistical methods on realistic null data.},

Commentaries on that paper were received by Nichols, Eklund, and Knutsson (this issue), Hopfinger (this issue), and Cunningham and Koscik (this issue). In this author response, I consider these commentaries. Many issues stemming from Nichols et al. are identified including: (1) Nichols et al. did not provide convincing arguments that resting-state fMRI data reflect null data. (2) Eklund et al. presented one-sample t-test results in the main body of their paper showing that their permutation method was acceptable, while their supplementary results showed that this method produced false-positive rates that were similar to other methods. (3) Eklund et al. used the same event protocol for all the participants, which artifactually inflated the one-sample t-test false-positive rates. (4) At p {\textless} .001, using two-sample t-tests (which corrected for the flawed analysis), all the methods employed to correct for multiple comparisons had acceptable false-positive rates. (5) Eklund et al. contrasted resting-state periods, which produced many significant clusters of activity, while null data should arguably be associated with few, if any, significant activations. Eklund et al.’s entire set of results show that commonly employed methods to correct for multiple comparisons have acceptable false-positive rates. Following Hopfinger along with Cunningham and Koscik, it is also highlighted that rather than focusing on only type I error, type I error and type II error should be balanced in fMRI analysis.},

	abstract = {Background
There is considerable evidence that the thalamus is abnormal in psychotic disorders. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed an intriguing pattern of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis characterized by reduced prefrontal cortex (PFC) connectivity and increased somatomotor-thalamic connectivity. However, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the onset, anatomical specificity, and clinical correlates of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis.
Methods
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected on 105 healthy subjects and 148 individuals with psychosis, including 53 early-stage psychosis patients. Using all 253 subjects, the thalamus was parceled into functional regions of interest (ROIs) on the basis of connectivity with six a priori defined cortical ROIs covering most of the cortical mantle. Functional connectivity between each cortical ROI and its corresponding thalamic ROI was quantified and compared across groups. Significant differences in the ROI-to-ROI analysis were followed up with voxelwise seed-based analyses to further localize thalamic dysconnectivity.
Results
ROI analysis revealed reduced PFC-thalamic connectivity and increased somatomotor-thalamic connectivity in both chronic and early-stage psychosis patients. PFC hypoconnectivity and motor cortex hyperconnectivity correlated in patients, suggesting that they result from a common pathophysiological mechanism. Seed-based analyses revealed thalamic hypoconnectivity in psychosis localized to dorsolateral PFC, medial PFC, and cerebellar areas of the well-described executive control network. Across all subjects, thalamic connectivity with areas of the fronto-parietal network correlated with cognitive functioning, including verbal learning and memory.
Conclusions
Thalamocortical dysconnectivity is present in both chronic and early stages of psychosis, includes reduced thalamic connectivity with the executive control network, and is related to cognitive impairment.},

This article reviews the growing literature on the development of functional networks, from infancy through adolescence, as measured by resting-state functional connectivity MRI. We note several limitations of traditional approaches to describing brain networks and describe a powerful framework for analyzing networks, called graph theory. We argue that characterization of the development of brain systems (e.g., the default mode network) should be comprehensive, considering not only relationships within a given system, but also how these relationships are situated within wider network contexts. We note that, despite substantial reorganization of functional connectivity, several large-scale network properties appear to be preserved across development, suggesting that functional brain networks, even in children, are organized in manners similar to other complex systems.},

We develop a framework in which the False Discovery Proportion (FDP)—the number of false rejections divided by the number of rejections—is treated as a stochastic process. After obtaining the limiting distribution of the process, we demonstrate the validity of a class of procedures for controlling the False Discovery Rate (the expected FDP). We construct a confidence envelope for the whole FDP process. From these envelopes we derive confidence thresholds, for controlling the quantiles of the distribution of the FDP as well as controlling the number of false discoveries. We also investigate methods for estimating the p-value distribution.},

Working memory (WM) is a key element of executive function, but it is not known what brain changes during adolescence allow improved WM performance. Using a fractal n-back fMRI paradigm, we investigated brain responses to WM load in 951 human youths aged 8–22 years. Compared with more limited associations with age, WM performance was robustly associated with both executive network activation and deactivation of the default mode network. Multivariate patterns of brain activation predicted task performance with a high degree of accuracy, and also mediated the observed age-related improvements in WM performance. These results delineate a process of functional maturation of the executive system, and suggest that this process allows for the improvement of cognitive capability seen during adolescence.},

	abstract = {A critical issue in many neuroimaging studies is the comparison between brain maps. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how one should test hypotheses focused on the overlap or spatial correspondence between two or more brain maps. This “correspondence problem” affects, for example, the interpretation of comparisons between task-based patterns of functional activation, resting-state networks or modules, and neuroanatomical landmarks. To date, this problem has been addressed with remarkable variability in terms of methodological approaches and statistical rigor. In this paper, we address the correspondence problem using a spatial permutation framework to generate null models of overlap by applying random rotations to spherical representations of the cortical surface, an approach for which we also provide a theoretical statistical foundation. We use this method to derive clusters of cognitive functions that are correlated in terms of their functional neuroatomical substrates. In addition, using publicly available data, we formally demonstrate the correspondence between maps of task-based functional activity, resting-state fMRI networks and gyral-based anatomical landmarks. We provide open-access code to implement the methods presented for two commonly-used tools for surface based cortical analysis (https://www.github.com/spin-test). This spatial permutation approach constitutes a useful advance over widely-used methods for the comparison of cortical maps, thereby opening new possibilities for the integration of diverse neuroimaging data.},

However, studies of brain development in youth have focused on describing how cortical thickness varies over large-scale functional and anatomic regions. How the relationship between thickness and local sulcal topology arises in development is still not well understood. Here, we investigated the spatial relationships between cortical thickness, folding, and underlying white matter organization to elucidate the influence of local topology on human brain development. Our approach included using both T1-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a cross-sectional sample of 932 youths ages 8–21 studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Principal components analysis revealed separable development-related processes of regionally specific nonlinear cortical thickening (from ages 8–14) and widespread linear cortical thinning that have dissociable relationships with cortical topology. Whereas cortical thinning was most prominent in the depths of the sulci, early cortical thickening was present on the gyri. Furthermore, decline in mean diffusivity calculated from DTI in underlying white matter was correlated with cortical thinning, suggesting that cortical thinning is spatially associated with white matter development. Spatial permutation tests were used to assess the significance of these relationships. Together, these data demonstrate that cortical remodeling during youth occurs on a local topological scale and is associated with changes in white matter beneath the cortical surface.},

The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a non-degenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable large-scale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly.},

	abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. Here, the authors propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. The authors show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, the authors show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

Since these nuclei are known to have different functions and to be connected to different areas of the cerebral cortex, it is of great interest for the neuroimaging community to study their volume, shape and connectivity in vivo with MRI. In this study, we present a probabilistic atlas of the thalamic nuclei built using ex vivo brain MRI scans and histological data, as well as the application of the atlas to in vivo MRI segmentation. The atlas was built using manual delineation of 26 thalamic nuclei on the serial histology of 12 whole thalami from six autopsy samples, combined with manual segmentations of the whole thalamus and surrounding structures (caudate, putamen, hippocampus, etc.) made on in vivo brain MR data from 39 subjects. The 3D structure of the histological data and corresponding manual segmentations was recovered using the ex vivo MRI as reference frame, and stacks of blockface photographs acquired during the sectioning as intermediate target. The atlas, which was encoded as an adaptive tetrahedral mesh, shows a good agreement with previous histological studies of the thalamus in terms of volumes of representative nuclei. When applied to segmentation of in vivo scans using Bayesian inference, the atlas shows excellent test-retest reliability, robustness to changes in input MRI contrast, and ability to detect differential thalamic effects in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The probabilistic atlas and companion segmentation tool are publicly available as part of the neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.},

In particular, the impact of spatiotemporal data resolution on the resulting connectivity findings has not been sufficiently investigated. In fact, a number of studies have already observed that functional networks often give different conclusions across different parcellation scales. If the interpretations from functional networks are inconsistent across spatiotemporal scales, then the whole validity of the functional network paradigm is called into question. This paper investigates the consistency of resting state network structure when using different temporal sampling or spatial parcellation, or different methods for constructing the networks. To pursue this, we develop a novel network comparison framework based on persistent homology from a topological data analysis. We use the new network comparison tools to characterize the spatial and temporal scales under which consistent functional networks can be constructed. The methods are illustrated on Human Connectome Project data, showing that the DISCOH2 network construction method outperforms other approaches at most data spatiotemporal resolutions.},

Then, second, relevant experts, sketch a number of emerging methods, which can break through these limitations. In particular we discuss five such methods.

	abstract = {A new methodology is proposed for estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses in a large collection of tests. Each test concerns a single parameter δ whose value is specified by the null hypothesis. We combine a parametric model for the conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the p-value given δ with a nonparametric spline model for the density g(δ) of δ under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion of true null hypotheses and the coefficients in the spline model are estimated by penalized least squares subject to constraints that guarantee that the spline is a density. The estimator is computed efficiently using quadratic programming. Our methodology produces an estimate of the density of δ when the null is false and can address such questions as “when the null is false, is the parameter usually close to the null or far away?” This leads us to define a falsely interesting discovery rate (FIDR), a generalization of the false discovery rate. We contrast the FIDR approach to Efron's (2004, Journal of the American Statistical Association99, 96–104) empirical null hypothesis technique. We discuss the use of in sample size calculations based on the expected discovery rate (EDR). Our recommended estimator of the proportion of true nulls has less bias compared to estimators based upon the marginal density of the p-values at 1. In a simulation study, we compare our estimators to the convex, decreasing estimator of Langaas, Lindqvist, and Ferkingstad (2005, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B67, 555–572). The most biased of our estimators is very similar in performance to the convex, decreasing estimator.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Puberty is the defining process of adolescence, and is accompanied by divergent trajectories of behavior and cognition for males and females. Here we examine whether sex differences exist in the effect of puberty on the morphology of the hippocampus and amygdala.
METHOD: T1-weighted structural neuroimaging was performed in a sample of 524 pre- or postpubertal individuals ages 10 to 22 years. Hippocampal and amygdala volume and shape were quantified using the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) FIRST procedure and scaled by intracranial volume. The effects on regional volume of age, sex, puberty, and their interactions were examined using linear regression. Postpubertal sex differences were examined using a vertex analysis.
RESULTS: Prepubertal males and females had similar hippocampal volumes, whereas postpubertal females had significantly larger bilateral hippocampi, resulting in a significant puberty-by-sex interaction even when controlling for age and age-by-sex. This effect was regionally specific and was not apparent in the amygdala. Vertex analysis revealed that postpubertal differences were most prominent in the lateral aspect of the hippocampus bilaterally, corresponding to the CA1 subfield.
CONCLUSIONS: These results establish that there are regionally specific sex differences in the effect of puberty on the hippocampus. These findings are relevant for the understanding of psychiatric disorders that have both hippocampal dysfunction and prominent gender disparities during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses, π0, has attracted much attention in the recent statistical literature. Besides its apparent relevance for a set of specific scientific hypotheses, an accurate estimate of this parameter is key for many multiple testing procedures. Most existing methods for estimating π0 in the literature are motivated from the independence assumption of test statistics, which is often not true in reality. Simulations indicate that most existing estimators in the presence of the dependence among test statistics can be poor, mainly due to the increase of variation in these estimators. In this paper, we propose several data-driven methods for estimating π0 by incorporating the distribution pattern of the observed p-values as a practical approach to address potential dependence among test statistics. Specifically, we use a linear fit to give a data-driven estimate for the proportion of true-null p-values in (λ, 1] over the whole range [0, 1] instead of using the expected proportion at 1 − λ. We find that the proposed estimators may substantially decrease the variance of the estimated true null proportion and thus improve the overall performance.},

The procedure given there was shown to control the FDR for independent test statistics. When some of the hypotheses are in fact false, that procedure is too conservative. We present here an adaptive procedure, where the number of true null hypotheses is estimated first as in Hochberg and Benjamini (1990), and this estimate is used in the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). The result is still a simple stepwise procedure, to which we also give a graphical companion. The new procedure is used in several examples drawn from educational and behavioral studies, addressing problems in multi-center studies, subset analysis and meta-analysis. The examples vary in the number of hypotheses tested, and the implication of the new procedure on the conclusions. In a large simulation study of independent test statistics the adaptive procedure is shown to control the FDR and have substantially better power than the previously suggested FDR controlling method, which by itself is more powerful than the traditional family wise error-rate controlling methods. In cases where most of the tested hypotheses are far from being true there is hardly any penalty due to the simultaneous testing of many hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Data quality is increasingly recognized as one of the most important confounding factors in brain imaging research. It is particularly important for studies of brain development, where age is systematically related to in-scanner motion and data quality. Prior work has demonstrated that in-scanner head motion biases estimates of structural neuroimaging measures. However, objective measures of data quality are not available for most structural brain images. Here we sought to identify quantitative measures of data quality for T1-weighted volumes, describe how these measures relate to cortical thickness, and delineate how this in turn may bias inference regarding associations with age in youth. Three highly-trained raters provided manual ratings of 1840 raw T1-weighted volumes. These images included a training set of 1065 images from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), a test set of 533 images from the PNC, as well as an external test set of 242 adults acquired on a different scanner. Manual ratings were compared to automated quality measures provided by the Preprocessed Connectomes Project's Quality Assurance Protocol (QAP), as well as FreeSurfer's Euler number, which summarizes the topological complexity of the reconstructed cortical surface. Results revealed that the Euler number was consistently correlated with manual ratings across samples. Furthermore, the Euler number could be used to identify images scored “unusable” by human raters with a high degree of accuracy (AUC: 0.98–0.99), and out-performed proxy measures from functional timeseries acquired in the same scanning session. The Euler number also was significantly related to cortical thickness in a regionally heterogeneous pattern that was consistent across datasets and replicated prior results. Finally, data quality both inflated and obscured associations with age during adolescence. Taken together, these results indicate that reliable measures of data quality can be automatically derived from T1-weighted volumes, and that failing to control for data quality can systematically bias the results of studies of brain maturation.},

	abstract = {Background Reaction time (RT) is one of the most widely used measures of performance in experimental psychology, yet relatively few fMRI studies have included trial-by-trial differences in RT as a predictor variable in their analyses. Using a multi-study approach, we investigated whether there are brain regions that show a general relationship between trial-by-trial RT variability and activation across a range of cognitive tasks. Methodology/Principal Findings The relation between trial-by-trial differences in RT and brain activation was modeled in five different fMRI datasets spanning a range of experimental tasks and stimulus modalities. Three main findings were identified. First, in a widely distributed set of gray and white matter regions, activation was delayed on trials with long RTs relative to short RTs, suggesting delayed initiation of underlying physiological processes. Second, in lateral and medial frontal regions, activation showed a “time-on-task” effect, increasing linearly as a function of RT. Finally, RT variability reliably modulated the BOLD signal not only in gray matter but also in diffuse regions of white matter. Conclusions/Significance The results highlight the importance of modeling trial-by-trial RT in fMRI analyses and raise the possibility that RT variability may provide a powerful probe for investigating the previously elusive white matter BOLD signal.},

	abstract = {Obtaining quantitative measures from biomedical images often requires segmentation, i.e., finding and outlining the structures of interest. Multi-modality imaging datasets, in which multiple imaging measures are available at each spatial location, are increasingly common, particularly in MRI. In applications where fully automatic segmentation algorithms are unavailable or fail to perform at desired levels of accuracy, semi-automatic segmentation can be a time-saving alternative to manual segmentation, allowing the human expert to guide segmentation, while minimizing the effort expended by the expert on repetitive tasks that can be automated. However, few existing 3D image analysis tools support semi-automatic segmentation of multi-modality imaging data. This paper describes new extensions to the ITK-SNAP interactive image visualization and segmentation tool that support semi-automatic segmentation of multi-modality imaging datasets in a way that utilizes information from all available modalities simultaneously. The approach combines Random Forest classifiers, trained by the user by placing several brushstrokes in the image, with the active contour segmentation algorithm. The new multi-modality semi-automatic segmentation approach is evaluated in the context of high-grade glioblastoma segmentation.},

To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing.

	abstract = {The false discovery rate (FDR), or the expected proportion of falsely rejected null hypotheses to rejected null hypotheses, has recently been proposed as an error rate that multiple testing procedures should in certain circumstances control. So far, only a step-up procedure for independent test statistics has been created explicitly to control the FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). In this paper, step-down and step-up procedures are described which asymptotically (as N→∞) control the FDR when the test statistics are the t statistics from consistent multivariate normal estimators of the tested parameters. Determination of the necessary critical constants for the normal theory procedures is achieved using numerical integration when the correlations are equal, or through simulation using the multivariate t distribution when the correlations are arbitrary. The critical constants of the normal theory procedures are compared to those of the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure under the normal assumption, and a large potential power increase is found. Simulation strongly supports the use of critical constants, obtained by an asymptotic argument, in small samples for as many as 30 tests. Adjusted FDR values can be found to quantify the evidence against a given hypothesis.},

Here we study graphs of functional brain organization in healthy adults using resting state functional connectivity MRI. We propose two novel brain-wide graphs, one of 264 putative functional areas, the other a modification of voxelwise networks that eliminates potentially artificial short-distance relationships. These graphs contain many subgraphs in good agreement with known functional brain systems. Other subgraphs lack established functional identities; we suggest possible functional characteristics for these subgraphs. Further, graph measures of the areal network indicate that the default mode subgraph shares network properties with sensory and motor subgraphs: it is internally integrated but isolated from other subgraphs, much like a “processing” system. The modified voxelwise graph also reveals spatial motifs in the patterning of systems across the cortex.},

The algorithm is designed to calculate an adaptive finite dimensional solution to the penalized likelihood problem, which was shown by Gu and Qiu to share the same asymptotic convergence rates as the nonadaptive infinite dimensional solution. The smoothing parameter is updated jointly with the estimate in a performance-oriented iteration via a cross-validation performance estimate, where the performance is measured by proxies of the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler distance between the true density and the estimate. Simulations of limited scale are conducted to examine the relative effectiveness of the automatic smoothing parameter selection procedure and to assess the practical statistical performance of the methodology in general. The method is also applied to some real data sets. The algorithm is implemented in a few Ratfor routines, which will be included in later versions of RKPACK for public access.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Statistical theory and simulations of effect sizes, log odds ratios and regression coefficients demonstrate that this unrestricted weighted least squares estimator provides satisfactory estimates and confidence intervals that are comparable to random effects when there is no publication (or small-sample) bias and identical to fixed-effect meta-analysis when there is no heterogeneity. When there is publication selection bias, the unrestricted weighted least squares approach dominates random effects; when there is excess heterogeneity, it is clearly superior to fixed-effect meta-analysis. In practical applications, an unrestricted weighted least squares weighted average will often provide superior estimates to both conventional fixed and random effects.

Suppose that two sets of measurements are available on the same set of observations. Sparse CCA is a method for identifying sparse linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are highly correlated with each other. It has been shown to be useful in the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, when two sets of assays are available on the same set of samples. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the sparse CCA methodology. (1) Sparse CCA is an unsupervised method; that is, it does not make use of outcome measurements that may be available for each observation (e.g., survival time or cancer subtype). We propose an extension to sparse CCA, which we call sparse supervised CCA, which results in the identification of linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are correlated with each other and associated with the outcome. (2) It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to collect data on more than two assays on the same set of samples; for instance, SNP, gene expression, and DNA copy number measurements may all be available. We develop sparse multiple CCA in order to extend the sparse CCA methodology to the case of more than two data sets. We demonstrate these new methods on simulated data and on a recently published and publicly available diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set.},

In this work, we present a Bayesian extension of voxel-level analyses that offers several notable benefits. Among these, it combines whole-brain voxel-by-voxel modeling and ROI analyses within a unified framework. Secondly, an unstructured variance/covariance matrix for regional mean parameters allows for the study of inter-regional (long-range) correlations, and the model employs an exchangeable correlation structure to capture intra-regional (short-range) correlations. Estimation is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques implemented via Gibbs sampling.

	abstract = {The problem of multiple testing for the presence of signal in spatial data can involve numerous locations. Traditionally, each location is tested separately for signal presence, but then the findings are reported in terms of clusters of nearby locations. This is an indication that the units of interest for testing are clusters rather than individual locations. The investigator may know a priori these more natural units or an approximation to them. We suggest testing these cluster units rather than individual locations, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio within the unit tested as well as reducing the number of hypothesis tests conducted. Because the signal may be absent from part of each cluster, we define a cluster as containing a signal if the signal is present somewhere within the cluster. We suggest controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) on clusters (i.e., the expected proportion of clusters rejected erroneously out of all clusters rejected) or its extension to general weights (WFDR). We introduce a powerful two-stage testing procedure and show that it controls the WFDR. Once the cluster discoveries have been made, we suggest "cleaning" locations in which the signal is absent. For this purpose, we develop a hierarchical testing procedure that first tests clusters, then tests locations within rejected clusters. We show formally that this procedure controls the desired location error rate asymptotically, and conjecture that this is also so for realistic settings by extensive simulations. We discuss an application to functional neuroimaging that motivated this research and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methodology on an example.},

	abstract = {Nonparametric hypothesis testing for a spatial signal can involve a large number of hypotheses. For instance, two satellite images of the same scene, taken before and after an event, could be used to test a hypothesis that the event has no environmental impact. This is equivalent to testing that the mean difference of “after-before” is zero at each of the (typically thousands of) pixels that make up the scene. In such a situation, conventional testing procedures that control the overall type I error deteriorate as the number of hypotheses increases. Powerful testing procedures are needed for this problem of testing for the presence of a spatial signal. In this article we propose a procedure called enhanced false discovery rate (EFDR), which is based on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and a concept known as generalized degrees of freedom. EFDR differs from the standard FDR procedure by reducing the number of hypotheses tested. This is done in two ways: first, the model is represented more parsimoniously in the wavelet domain; second, an optimal selection of hypotheses is made using a criterion based on generalized degrees of freedom. Not only does the EFDR procedure tell us whether a spatial signal is present, but, if a signal is deemed present, it can also indicate its location and magnitude. We examine EFDR's operating characteristics and in simulations show that it outperforms the standard FDR and conventional testing procedures. Finally, we apply the EFDR procedure to an air temperature dataset generated from the climate system model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in which air temperatures in the 1980s are compared to those in the 1990s. We conclude that temperature change has occurred between the two decades, mostly warming in the central part of the United States and in coastal regions of South America at about 20°S.},

	abstract = {This paper contains a new approach toward a theory of robust estimation; it treats in detail the asymptotic theory of estimating a location parameter for contaminated normal distributions, and exhibits estimators--intermediaries between sample mean and sample median--that are asymptotically most robust (in a sense to be specified) among all translation invariant estimators. For the general background, see Tukey (1960) (p. 448 ff.) Let x1,⋯,xnx1,⋯,xnx\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, x\_n be independent random variables with common distribution function F(t−ξ)F(t−ξ)F(t - {\textbackslash}xi). The problem is to estimate the location parameter ξξ{\textbackslash}xi, but with the complication that the prototype distribution F(t)F(t)F(t) is only approximately known. I shall primarily be concerned with the model of indeterminacy F=(1−ϵ)Φ+ϵHF=(1−ϵ)Φ+ϵHF = (1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon){\textbackslash}Phi + {\textbackslash}epsilon H, where 0≦ϵ{\textless}10≦ϵ{\textless}10 {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon {\textless} 1 is a known number, Φ(t)=(2π)−12∫t−∞exp(−12s2)dsΦ(t)=(2π)−12∫−∞texp⁡(−12s2)ds{\textbackslash}Phi(t) = (2{\textbackslash}pi){\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\} {\textbackslash}int{\textasciicircum}t\_\{-{\textbackslash}infty\} {\textbackslash}exp(-{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}s{\textasciicircum}2) ds is the standard normal cumulative and HHH is an unknown contaminating distribution. This model arises for instance if the observations are assumed to be normal with variance 1, but a fraction ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon of them is affected by gross errors. Later on, I shall also consider other models of indeterminacy, e.g., supt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ(t){\textbar}≦ϵsupt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ(t){\textbar}≦ϵ{\textbackslash}sup\_t {\textbar}F(t) - {\textbackslash}Phi(t){\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon. Some inconvenience is caused by the fact that location and scale parameters are not uniquely determined: in general, for fixed ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon, there will be several values of ξξ{\textbackslash}xi and σσ{\textbackslash}sigma such that supt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ((t−ξ)/σ){\textbar}≦ϵsupt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ((t−ξ)/σ){\textbar}≦ϵ{\textbackslash}sup\_t{\textbar}F(t) - {\textbackslash}Phi((t - {\textbackslash}xi)/{\textbackslash}sigma){\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon, and similarly for the contaminated case. Although this inherent and unavoidable indeterminacy is small if ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon is small and is rather irrelevant for practical purposes, it poses awkward problems for the theory, especially for optimality questions. To remove this difficulty, one may either (i) restrict attention to symmetric distributions, and estimate the location of the center of symmetry (this works for ξξ{\textbackslash}xi but not for σσ{\textbackslash}sigma); or (ii) one may define the parameter to be estimated in terms of the estimator itself, namely by its asymptotic value for sample size n→∞n→∞n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty; or (iii) one may define the parameters by arbitrarily chosen functionals of the distribution (e.g., by the expectation, or the median of FFF). All three possibilities have unsatisfactory aspects, and I shall usually choose the variant which is mathematically most convenient. It is interesting to look back to the very origin of the theory of estimation, namely to Gauss and his theory of least squares. Gauss was fully aware that his main reason for assuming an underlying normal distribution and a quadratic loss function was mathematical, i.e., computational, convenience. In later times, this was often forgotten, partly because of the central limit theorem. However, if one wants to be honest, the central limit theorem can at most explain why many distributions occurring in practice are approximately normal. The stress is on the word "approximately." This raises a question which could have been asked already by Gauss, but which was, as far as I know, only raised a few years ago (notably by Tukey): What happens if the true distribution deviates slightly from the assumed normal one? As is now well known, the sample mean then may have a catastrophically bad performance: seemingly quite mild deviations may already explode its variance. Tukey and others proposed several more robust substitutes--trimmed means, Winsorized means, etc.--and explored their performance for a few typical violations of normality. A general theory of robust estimation is still lacking; it is hoped that the present paper will furnish the first few steps toward such a theory. At the core of the method of least squares lies the idea to minimize the sum of the squared "errors," that is, to adjust the unknown parameters such that the sum of the squares of the differences between observed and computed values is minimized. In the simplest case, with which we are concerned here, namely the estimation of a location parameter, one has to minimize the expression ∑i(xi−T)2∑i(xi−T)2{\textbackslash}sum\_i (x\_i - T){\textasciicircum}2; this is of course achieved by the sample mean T=∑ixi/nT=∑ixi/nT = {\textbackslash}sum\_i x\_i/n. I should like to emphasize that no loss function is involved here; I am only describing how the least squares estimator is defined, and neither the underlying family of distributions nor the true value of the parameter to be estimated enters so far. It is quite natural to ask whether one can obtain more robustness by minimizing another function of the errors than the sum of their squares. We shall therefore concentrate our attention to estimators that can be defined by a minimum principle of the form (for a location parameter): T=Tn(x1,⋯,xn)minimizes∑iρ(xi−T),T=Tn(x1,⋯,xn)minimizes∑iρ(xi−T),T = T\_n(x\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, x\_n) minimizes {\textbackslash}sum\_i {\textbackslash}rho(x\_i - T), whereρisanon−constantfunction.(M)(M)whereρisanon−constantfunction.{\textbackslash}begin\{equation*\} {\textbackslash}tag\{M\} where {\textbackslash}rho is a non-constant function. {\textbackslash}end\{equation*\} Of course, this definition generalizes at once to more general least squares type problems, where several parameters have to be determined. This class of estimators contains in particular (i) the sample mean (ρ(t)=t2)(ρ(t)=t2)({\textbackslash}rho(t) = t{\textasciicircum}2), (ii) the sample median (ρ(t)={\textbar}t{\textbar})(ρ(t)={\textbar}t{\textbar})({\textbackslash}rho(t) = {\textbar}t{\textbar}), and more generally, (iii) all maximum likelihood estimators (ρ(t)=−logf(t)(ρ(t)=−log⁡f(t)({\textbackslash}rho(t) = -{\textbackslash}log f(t), where fff is the assumed density of the untranslated distribution). These (MMM)-estimators, as I shall call them for short, have rather pleasant asymptotic properties; sufficient conditions for asymptotic normality and an explicit expression for their asymptotic variance will be given. How should one judge the robustness of an estimator Tn(x)=Tn(x1,⋯,xn)Tn(x)=Tn(x1,⋯,xn)T\_n(x) = T\_n(x\_1, {\textbackslash}cdots, x\_n)? Since ill effects from contamination are mainly felt for large sample sizes, it seems that one should primarily optimize large sample robustness properties. Therefore, a convenient measure of robustness for asymptotically normal estimators seems to be the supremum of the asymptotic variance (n→∞)(n→∞)(n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty) when FFF ranges over some suitable set of underlying distributions, in particular over the set of all F=(1−ϵ)Φ+ϵHF=(1−ϵ)Φ+ϵHF = (1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon){\textbackslash}Phi + {\textbackslash}epsilon H for fixed ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon and symmetric HHH. On second thought, it turns out that the asymptotic variance is not only easier to handle, but that even for moderate values of nnn it is a better measure of performance than the actual variance, because (i) the actual variance of an estimator depends very much on the behavior of the tails of HHH, and the supremum of the actual variance is infinite for any estimator whose value is always contained in the convex hull of the observations. (ii) If an estimator is asymptotically normal, then the important central part of its distribution and confidence intervals for moderate confidence levels can better be approximated in terms of the asymptotic variance than in terms of the actual variance. If we adopt this measure of robustness, and if we restrict attention to (MMM)-estimators, then it will be shown that the most robust estimator is uniquely determined and corresponds to the following ρ:ρ(t)=12t2ρ:ρ(t)=12t2{\textbackslash}rho:{\textbackslash}rho(t) = {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}t{\textasciicircum}2 for {\textbar}t{\textbar}{\textless}k,ρ(t)=k{\textbar}t{\textbar}−12k2{\textbar}t{\textbar}{\textless}k,ρ(t)=k{\textbar}t{\textbar}−12k2{\textbar}t{\textbar} {\textless} k, {\textbackslash}rho(t) = k{\textbar}t{\textbar} - {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}k{\textasciicircum}2 for {\textbar}t{\textbar}≧k{\textbar}t{\textbar}≧k{\textbar}t{\textbar} {\textbackslash}geqq k, with kkk depending on ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon. This estimator is most robust even among all translation invariant estimators. Sample mean (k=∞)(k=∞)(k = {\textbackslash}infty) and sample median (k=0)(k=0)(k = 0) are limiting cases corresponding to ϵ=0ϵ=0{\textbackslash}epsilon = 0 and ϵ=1ϵ=1{\textbackslash}epsilon = 1, respectively, and the estimator is closely related and asymptotically equivalent to Winsorizing. I recall the definition of Winsorizing: assume that the observations have been ordered, x1≦x2≦⋯≦xnx1≦x2≦⋯≦xnx\_1 {\textbackslash}leqq x\_2 {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}cdots {\textbackslash}leqq x\_n, then the statistic T=n−1(gxg+1+xg+1+xg+2+⋯+xn−h+hxn−h)T=n−1(gxg+1+xg+1+xg+2+⋯+xn−h+hxn−h)T = n{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}(gx\_\{g + 1\} + x\_\{g + 1\} + x\_\{g + 2\} + {\textbackslash}cdots + x\_\{n - h\} + hx\_\{n - h\}) is called the Winsorized mean, obtained by Winsorizing the ggg leftmost and the hhh rightmost observations. The above most robust (MMM)-estimators can be described by the same formula, except that in the first and in the last summand, the factors xg+1xg+1x\_\{g + 1\} and xn−hxn−hx\_\{n - h\} have to be replaced by some numbers u,vu,vu, v satisfying xg≦u≦xg+1xg≦u≦xg+1x\_g {\textbackslash}leqq u {\textbackslash}leqq x\_\{g + 1\} and xn−h≦v≦xn−h+1xn−h≦v≦xn−h+1x\_\{n - h\} {\textbackslash}leqq v {\textbackslash}leqq x\_\{n - h + 1\}, respectively; g,h,ug,h,ug, h, u and vvv depend on the sample. In fact, this (MMM)-estimator is the maximum likelihood estimator corresponding to a unique least favorable distribution F0F0F\_0 with density f0(t)=(1−ϵ)(2π)−12e−ρ(t)f0(t)=(1−ϵ)(2π)−12e−ρ(t)f\_0(t) = (1 - {\textbackslash}epsilon)(2{\textbackslash}pi){\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}\}e{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}rho(t)\}. This f0f0f\_0 behaves like a normal density for small ttt, like an exponential density for large ttt. At least for me, this was rather surprising--I would have expected an f0f0f\_0 with much heavier tails. This result is a particular case of a more general one that can be stated roughly as follows: Assume that FFF belongs to some convex set CCC of distribution functions. Then the most robust (MMM)-estimator for the set CCC coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator for the unique F0εCF0εCF\_0 {\textbackslash}varepsilon C which has the smallest Fisher information number I(F)=∫(f′/f)2fdtI(F)=∫(f′/f)2fdtI(F) = {\textbackslash}int (f'/f){\textasciicircum}2f dt among all FεCFεCF {\textbackslash}varepsilon C. Miscellaneous related problems will also be treated: the case of non-symmetric contaminating distributions; the most robust estimator for the model of indeterminacy supt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ(t){\textbar}≦ϵsupt{\textbar}F(t)−Φ(t){\textbar}≦ϵ{\textbackslash}sup\_t{\textbar}F(t) - {\textbackslash}Phi(t){\textbar} {\textbackslash}leqq {\textbackslash}epsilon; robust estimation of a scale parameter; how to estimate location, if scale and ϵϵ{\textbackslash}epsilon are unknown; numerical computation of the estimators; more general estimators, e.g., minimizing ∑i{\textless}jρ(xi−T,xj−T)∑i{\textless}jρ(xi−T,xj−T){\textbackslash}sum\_\{i {\textless} j\} {\textbackslash}rho(x\_i - T, x\_j - T), where ρρ{\textbackslash}rho is a function of two arguments. Questions of small sample size theory will not be touched in this paper.},

	abstract = {With the advance of modern technology, more and more data are being recorded continuously during a time interval or intermittently at several discrete time points. These are both examples of functional data, which has become a commonly encountered type of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) encompasses the statistical methodology for such data. Broadly interpreted, FDA deals with the analysis and theory of data that are in the form of functions. This paper provides an overview of FDA, starting with simple statistical notions such as mean and covariance functions, then covering some core techniques, the most popular of which is functional principal component analysis (FPCA). FPCA is an important dimension reduction tool, and in sparse data situations it can be used to impute functional data that are sparsely observed. Other dimension reduction approaches are also discussed. In addition, we review another core technique, functional linear regression, as well as clustering and classification of functional data. Beyond linear and single- or multiple- index methods, we touch upon a few nonlinear approaches that are promising for certain applications. They include additive and other nonlinear functional regression models and models that feature time warping, manifold learning, and empirical differential equations. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future directions.},

	abstract = {Scientists and others today often collect samples of curves and other functional observations. This monograph presents many ideas and techniques for such data. Included are expressions in the functional domain of such classics as linear regression, principal components analysis, linear modeling, and canonical correlation analysis, as well as specifically functional techniques such as curve registration and principal differential analysis. Data arising in real applications are used throughout for both motivation and illustration, showing how functional approaches allow us to see new things, especially by exploiting the smoothness of the processes generating the data. The data sets exemplify the wide scope of functional data analysis; they are drawn from growth analysis, meteorology, biomechanics, equine science, economics, and medicine. The book presents novel statistical technology, much of it based on the authors’ own research work, while keeping the mathematical level widely accessible. It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields. This second edition is aimed at a wider range of readers, and especially those who would like to apply these techniques to their research problems. It complements the authors' other recent volume Applied Functional Data Analysis: Methods and Case Studies. In particular, there is an extended coverage of data smoothing and other matters arising in the preliminaries to a functional data analysis. The chapters on the functional linear model and modeling of the dynamics of systems through the use of differential equations and principal differential analysis have been completely rewritten and extended to include new developments. Other chapters have been revised substantially, often to give more weight to examples and practical considerations.

Modulation of thalamic connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is required for higher-order cognitive processes, which are often impaired in schizophrenia. To address this gap, we investigated how thalamus function and thalamus-PFC connectivity under different levels of cognitive demand may be disrupted in schizophrenia. Participants underwent fMRI scanning while performing an event-related two-alternative forced choice task under Single and Dual task conditions. In the Single task condition, participants responded either to a visual cue with a well-learned motor response, or an audio cue with a well-learned vocal response. In the Dual task condition, participants performed both tasks. Thalamic connectivity with task relevant regions of the PFC for each condition was measured using beta-series correlation. Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrated less modulation of both mediodorsal thalamus activation and thalamus-PFC connectivity with increased cognitive demand. In contrast, their ability to modulate PFC function during task performance was maintained. These results suggest that the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is associated with thalamus-PFC circuitry and suggests that the thalamus, along with the PFC, should be a focus of investigation.},

Here we introduce a novel extension of the p-value—a second-generation p-value (pδ)–that formally accounts for scientific relevance and leverages this natural Type I Error control. The approach relies on a pre-specified interval null hypothesis that represents the collection of effect sizes that are scientifically uninteresting or are practically null. The second-generation p-value is the proportion of data-supported hypotheses that are also null hypotheses. As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the data are compatible with null hypotheses (pδ = 1), or with alternative hypotheses (pδ = 0), or when the data are inconclusive (0 {\textless} pδ {\textless} 1). Moreover, second-generation p-values provide a proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive. Second-generation p-values promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori specifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with alternative or null hypotheses.},

The article contained a production-related error. The sixth equation under “Effect Sizes Specific to Comparing Two Conditions” should have had a plus sign rather than a minus sign in the denominator. All versions of this article have been corrected.] The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association, 2001, American Psychological Association, 2010) calls for the reporting of effect sizes and their confidence intervals. Estimates of effect size are useful for determining the practical or theoretical importance of an effect, the relative contributions of factors, and the power of an analysis. We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size. The most often reported analysis was analysis of variance, and almost half of these reports were not accompanied by effect sizes. Partial η2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance. For t tests, 2/3 of the articles did not report an associated effect size estimate; Cohen's d was the most often reported. We provide a straightforward guide to understanding, selecting, calculating, and interpreting effect sizes for many types of data and to methods for calculating effect size confidence intervals and power analysis.

	abstract = {Estimation of effect size is of interest in many applied fields such as Psychology, Sociology and Education. However there are few nonparametric estimators of effect size proposed in the existing literature, and little is known about the distributional characteristics of these estimators. In this article, two estimators based on the sample quantiles are proposed and studied. The first one is the estimator suggested by Hedges and Olkin (see page 93 of Hedges \& Olkin, 1985) for the situation where a treatment effect is evaluated against a control group (Case A). A modified version of the robust estimator by Hedges and Olkin is also proposed for the situation where two parallel treatments are compared (Case B). Large sample distributions of both estimators are derived. Their asymptotic relative efficiencies with respect to the normal maximum likelihood estimators under several common distributions are evaluated. The robust properties of the proposed estimators are discussed with respect to the sample-wise breakdown points proposed by Akritas (1991). Simulation studies are provided in which the performing characteristics of the proposed estimator are compared to that of the nonparametric estimators by Kraemer and Andrews (1982). Interval estimation of the effect sizes is also discussed. In an example, interval estimates for the data set in Kraemer and Andrews (1982) are calculated for both cases A and B.},

We address this issue head-on by asking a specific question: Across what domain, specifically, do we wish to control the Type I error rate? For example, do we wish to control it across all of science, across all of a specific discipline such as psychology, across a researcher's active lifetime, across a substantive research area, across an experiment, or across a set of hypotheses? In attempting to answer these questions, we show that each one leads to troubling dilemmas wherein controlling the Type I error rate turns out to be inconsistent with other scientific desiderata. This inconsistency implies that we must make a choice. In our view, the other scientific desiderata are much more valuable than controlling the Type I error rate and so it is the latter, rather than the former, with which we must dispense. But by doing so—that is, by eliminating the Type I error justification for computing and using p-values—there is even less reason to believe that p is useful for validly rejecting null hypotheses than previous critics have suggested.},

If researchers routinely report residual standard deviation, any subsequent review can combine both odds ratios and effect sizes in a single meta-analysis when this is justified.

	abstract = {The human brain is a complex system whose topological organization can be represented using connectomics. Recent studies have shown that human connectomes can be constructed using various neuroimaging technologies and further characterized using sophisticated analytic strategies, such as graph theory. These methods reveal the intriguing topological architectures of human brain networks in healthy populations and explore the changes throughout normal development and aging and under various pathological conditions. However, given the huge complexity of this methodology, toolboxes for graph-based network visualization are still lacking. Here, using MATLAB with a graphical user interface (GUI), we developed a graph-theoretical network visualization toolbox, called BrainNet Viewer, to illustrate human connectomes as ball-and-stick models. Within this toolbox, several combinations of defined files with connectome information can be loaded to display different combinations of brain surface, nodes and edges. In addition, display properties, such as the color and size of network elements or the layout of the figure, can be adjusted within a comprehensive but easy-to-use settings panel. Moreover, BrainNet Viewer draws the brain surface, nodes and edges in sequence and displays brain networks in multiple views, as required by the user. The figure can be manipulated with certain interaction functions to display more detailed information. Furthermore, the figures can be exported as commonly used image file formats or demonstration video for further use. BrainNet Viewer helps researchers to visualize brain networks in an easy, flexible and quick manner, and this software is freely available on the NITRC website (www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/).},

	abstract = {Medical imaging has shown that, during early development, the brain undergoes more changes in size, shape and appearance than at any other time in life. A better understanding of brain development requires a spatio-temporal atlas that characterizes the dynamic changes during this period. In this paper we present an approach for constructing a 4D atlas of the developing brain, between 28 and 44weeks post-menstrual age at time of scan, using T1 and T2 weighted MR images from 204 premature neonates. The method used for the creation of the average 4D atlas utilizes non-rigid registration between all pairs of images to eliminate bias in the atlas toward any of the original images. In addition, kernel regression is used to produce age-dependent anatomical templates. A novelty in our approach is the use of a time-varying kernel width, to overcome the variations in the distribution of subjects at different ages. This leads to an atlas that retains a consistent level of detail at every time-point. Comparisons between the resulting atlas and atlases constructed using affine and non-rigid registration are presented. The resulting 4D atlas has greater anatomic definition than currently available 4D atlases created using various affine and non-rigid registration approaches, an important factor in improving registrations between the atlas and individual subjects. Also, the resulting 4D atlas can serve as a good representative of the population of interest as it reflects both global and local changes. The atlas is publicly available at www.brain-development.org.},

	abstract = {When planning most scientific studies, one of the first steps is to carry out a power analysis to define a design and sample size that will result in a well-powered study. There are limited resources for calculating power for group fMRI studies due to the complexity of the model. Previous approaches for group fMRI power calculation simplify the study design and/or the variance structure in order to make the calculation possible. These approaches limit the designs that can be studied and may result in inaccurate power calculations. We introduce a flexible power calculation model that makes fewer simplifying assumptions, leading to a more accurate power analysis that can be used on a wide variety of study designs. Our power calculation model can be used to obtain region of interest (ROI) summaries of the mean parameters and variance parameters, which can be use to increase understanding of the data as well as calculate power for a future study. Our example illustrates that minimizing cost to achieve 80\% power is not as simple as finding the smallest sample size capable of achieving 80\% power, since smaller sample sizes require each subject to be scanned longer.},

The main focus of these methods is to prevent an inflation of false positives. However, this comes with a serious decrease in power and leads to a problematic imbalance between type I and type II errors. In this paper, we show how estimating the number of activated peaks or clusters enables one to estimate post-hoc how powerful the selection procedure performs. This procedure can be used in real studies as a diagnostics tool, and raises awareness on how much activation is potentially missed. The method is evaluated and illustrated using simulations and a real data example. Our real data example illustrates the lack of power in current fMRI research.},

We show that expected value of this criterion is minimized by the nuisance parameter model that yields the estimator of the parameter of interest with the smallest mean-squared error relative to the expected value of an initial consistent reference estimator. In a simulation study, we examine the performance of this criterion for selecting a model for a treatment mechanism in a marginal structural model (MSM) of point treatment data. For situations where all possible models cannot be evaluated, we outline a forward/backward model selection algorithm based on the cross validation criterion proposed in this paper and show how it can be used to select models for multiple nuisance parameters.

It also arises in (frequentist) attempts to estimate the error variance in regression models with informative priors on the regression coefficients, for example, in smoothing. It is argued that model complexity can be conceptualized as a feature of the joint distribution of the observed variables and the random parameters and might be formally described by a measure of dependence.

I argue that versions of the classical, logical, propensity and subjectivist interpretations also fall prey to their own variants of the reference class problem.

But I contend that they are all “no-theory” theories of probability - accounts that leave quite obscure why probability should function as a guide to life, a suitable basis for rational inference and action. The reference class problem besets those theories that are genuinely informative and that plausibly constrain our inductive reasonings and decisions.I distinguish a “metaphysical” and an “epistemological” reference class problem. I submit that we can dissolve the former problem by recognizing that probability is fundamentally a two-place notion: conditional probability is the proper primitive of probability theory. However, I concede that the epistemological problem remains.},

	abstract = {Time series regression has been developed and long used to evaluate the short-term associations of air pollution and weather with mortality or morbidity of non-infectious diseases. The application of the regression approaches from this tradition to infectious diseases, however, is less well explored and raises some new issues. We discuss and present potential solutions for five issues often arising in such analyses: changes in immune population, strong autocorrelations, a wide range of plausible lag structures and association patterns, seasonality adjustments, and large overdispersion. The potential approaches are illustrated with datasets of cholera cases and rainfall from Bangladesh and influenza and temperature in Tokyo. Though this article focuses on the application of the traditional time series regression to infectious diseases and weather factors, we also briefly introduce alternative approaches, including mathematical modeling, wavelet analysis, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Modifications proposed to standard time series regression practice include using sums of past cases as proxies for the immune population, and using the logarithm of lagged disease counts to control autocorrelation due to true contagion, both of which are motivated from “susceptible-infectious-recovered” (SIR) models. The complexity of lag structures and association patterns can often be informed by biological mechanisms and explored by using distributed lag non-linear models. For overdispersed models, alternative distribution models such as quasi-Poisson and negative binomial should be considered. Time series regression can be used to investigate dependence of infectious diseases on weather, but may need modifying to allow for features specific to this context.},

This study used fMRI to examine brain activity while interpreting communicative intent in 15 high-functioning youth with ASD and 16 age- and IQ-matched typically-developing (TD) controls. Participants completed the task with and without a tactile sensory distracter, and with and without instructions directing their attention to relevant social cues. When completing the task in the presence of the sensory distracter, TD youth showed increased activity in auditory language and frontal regions whereas ASD youth showed decreased activation in these areas. Instructions mitigated this effect such that ASD youth did not decrease activation during tactile stimulation; instead, the ASD group showed increased medial prefrontal activity. SOR severity modulated the effect of the tactile stimulus on social processing. Results demonstrate for the first time a neural mechanism through which sensory stimuli cause disruption of social cognition, and that attentional modulation can restore neural processing of social cues through prefrontal regulation. Findings have implications for novel, integrative interventions that incorporate attentional directives to target both sensory and social symptoms.},

Yet, it is currently unknown how variation in the OXTR relates to brain functioning in individuals with ASD, and, critically, whether neural endophenotypes vary as a function of aggregate genetic risk. Here, for we believe the first time, we use a multi-locus approach to examine how genetic variation across several OXTR single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affect functional connectivity of the brain’s reward network. Using data from 41 children with ASD and 41 neurotypical children, we examined functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) – a hub of the reward network – focusing on how connectivity varies with OXTR risk-allele dosage. Youth with ASD showed reduced NAcc connectivity with other areas in the reward circuit as a function of increased OXTR risk-allele dosage, as well as a positive association between risk-allele dosage and symptom severity, whereas neurotypical youth showed increased NAcc connectivity with frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing. In addition, we found that increased NAcc-frontal cortex connectivity in typically developing youth was related to better scores on a standardized measure of social functioning. Our results indicate that cumulative genetic variation on the OXTR impacts reward system connectivity in both youth with ASD and neurotypical controls. By showing differential genetic effects on neuroendophenotypes, these pathways elucidate mechanisms of vulnerability versus resilience in carriers of disease-associated risk alleles.},

	abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z {\textless} 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of “clusters” of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as “threshold-free cluster enhancement” (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

	abstract = {Background
Motivated by an inconsistency between reports of high diagnosis-classification accuracies and known heterogeneity in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), this study assessed classification accuracy in studies of ADHD as a function of methodological factors that can bias results. We hypothesized that high classification results in ADHD diagnosis are inflated by methodological factors.
Methods
We reviewed 69 studies (of 95 studies identified) that used neuroimaging features to predict ADHD diagnosis. Based on reported methods, we assessed the prevalence of circular analysis, which inflates classification accuracy, and evaluated the relationship between sample size and accuracy to test if small-sample models tend to report higher classification accuracy, also an indicator of bias.
Results
Circular analysis was detected in 15.9\% of ADHD classification studies, lack of independent test set was noted in 13\%, and insufficient methodological detail to establish its presence was noted in another 11.6\%. Accuracy of classification ranged from 60\% to 80\% in the 59.4\% of reviewed studies that met criteria for independence of feature selection, model construction, and test datasets. Moreover, there was a negative relationship between accuracy and sample size, implying additional bias contributing to reported accuracies at lower sample sizes.
Conclusions
High classification accuracies in neuroimaging studies of ADHD appear to be inflated by circular analysis and small sample size. Accuracies on independent datasets were consistent with known heterogeneity of the disorder. Steps to resolve these issues, and a shift toward accounting for sample heterogeneity and prediction of future outcomes, will be crucial in future classification studies in ADHD.},

In particular, 'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem, we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain the experimental effects in question. Spurious effects can appear in the context of both univariate activation analysis and multivariate pattern-information analysis. We suggest a policy for avoiding circularity.},

	abstract = {Numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported sex differences. To empirically evaluate for evidence of excessive significance bias in this literature, we searched for published fMRI studies of human brain to evaluate sex differences, regardless of the topic investigated, in Medline and Scopus over 10 years. We analyzed the prevalence of conclusions in favor of sex differences and the correlation between study sample sizes and number of significant foci identified. In the absence of bias, larger studies (better powered) should identify a larger number of significant foci. Across 179 papers, median sample size was n = 32 (interquartile range 23-47.5). A median of 5 foci related to sex differences were reported (interquartile range, 2-9.5). Few articles (n = 2) had titles focused on no differences or on similarities (n = 3) between sexes. Overall, 158 papers (88\%) reached “positive” conclusions in their abstract and presented some foci related to sex differences. There was no statistically significant relationship between sample size and the number of foci (−0.048\% increase for every 10 participants, p = 0.63). The extremely high prevalence of “positive” results and the lack of the expected relationship between sample size and the number of discovered foci reflect probable reporting bias and excess significance bias in this literature.},

	abstract = {Personality dimension extraversion describes individual differences in social behaviour and socio-emotional functioning. The intrinsic functional connectivity patterns of the brain are reportedly associated with extraversion. However, whether or not extraversion is associated with functional hubs warrants clarification. Functional hubs are involved in the rapid integration of neural processing, and their dysfunction contributes to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we employed the functional connectivity density (FCD) method for the first time to distinguish the energy-efficient hubs associated with extraversion. The resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 71 healthy subjects were used in the analysis. Short-range FCD was positively correlated with extraversion in the left cuneus, revealing a link between the local functional activity of this region and extraversion in risk-taking. Long-range FCD was negatively correlated with extraversion in the right superior frontal gyrus and the inferior frontal gyrus. Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses revealed that a decreased long-range FCD in individuals with high extraversion scores showed a low long-range functional connectivity pattern between the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and anterior cingulate cortex. This result suggests that decreased RSFC patterns are responsible for self-esteem, self-evaluation, and inhibitory behaviour system that account for the modulation and shaping of extraversion. Overall, our results emphasize specific brain hubs, and reveal long-range functional connections in relation to extraversion, thereby providing a neurobiological basis of extraversion.},

	abstract = {In the context of neuroimaging experiments, it is essential to account for the multiple comparisons problem when thresholding statistical mappings. Various methods are in use to deal with this issue, but they differ in their signal detection power for small- and large-scale effects. In this paper, we comprehensively describe a new method that is based on control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method increases sensitivity by exploiting the spatially clustered nature of neuroimaging effects. This is achieved by using a sliding window technique, in which FDR-control is first applied at a regional level. Thus, a new statistical map that is related to the regionally achieved FDR is derived from the available voxelwise P-values. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, thresholding based on this map is demonstrated to have better discriminatory power than conventional thresholding based on P-values. Secondly, it is shown that the resulting maps can be thresholded at a level that results in control of the global FDR. By means of statistical arguments and numerical simulations under widely varying conditions, our method is validated, characterized, and compared to some other common voxel-based methods (uncorrected thresholding, Bonferroni correction, and conventional FDR-control). It is found that our method shows considerably higher sensitivity as compared to conventional FDR-control, while still controlling the achieved FDR at the same level or better. Finally, our method is applied to two diverse neuroimaging experiments to assess its practical merits, resulting in substantial improvements as compared to the other methods.},

Correct inference using any of these criteria depends crucially on the specification of the null distribution of the test statistics. In this article we show examples from fMRI and DTI data where the theoretical null distribution does not match well the observed distribution of the test statistics. As a solution, we introduce the use of an empirical null, a null distribution empirically estimated from the data itself, allowing for global corrections of theoretical null assumptions. The theoretical null distributions considered are normal, t, χ2 and F, all commonly encountered in neuroimaging. The empirical null estimate is accompanied by an estimate of the proportion of non-active voxels in the data. Based on the two-class mixture model, we present the equivalence between the strategies of controlling FDR and thresholding posterior probabilities in the context of neuroimaging and show that the FDR estimates derived from the empirical null can be seen as empirical Bayes estimates.},

Conventionally, segmentation is carried out on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and nuclear parcellation using diffusion weighted MR images. We present the first fully automatic method that incorporates both tissue contrasts and several derived features to first segment and then parcellate the thalamus. We incorporate fractional anisotrophy, fiber orientation from the 5D Knutsson representation of the principal eigenvectors, and connectivity between the thalamus and the cortical lobes, as features. Combining these multiple information sources allows us to identify discriminating dimensions and thus parcellate the thalamic nuclei. A hierarchical random forest framework with a multidimensional feature per voxel, first distinguishes thalamus from background, and then separates each group of thalamic nuclei. Using a leave one out cross-validation on 12 subjects we have a mean Dice score of 0.805 and 0.799 for the left and right thalami, respectively. We also report overlap for the thalamic nuclear groups.},

We propose an automated segmentation algorithm using a set of features derived from diffusion tensor image (DTI) and thalamic nuclei location priors. After extracting features, a hierarchical random forest classifier is trained to locate the thalamus. A second random forest classifies thalamus voxels as belonging to one of six thalamic nuclei classes.

We present a segmentation method for individual subject diffusion tensor MR data that is based on local diffusion information to identify subregions of the thalamus. We show the correspondence of our segmentation results to anatomy by comparison with stereotactic atlas data. Importantly, we verify the consistency of our segmentation by evaluating the method on 63 healthy volunteers.

We determined localization, size and individual variations of 21 thalamic clusters in a group of 63 healthy human subjects (32 males/31 females). The laterality differences accounted for ±6 \% and gender differences for ±4 \% of the thalamic volume. Consecutively, five stable clusters in the anterior, medial, lateral and posterior thalamus were selected, which were common to 90 \% of all subjects and contained at least 10 voxels. These clusters could be assigned to the anteroventral nucleus (AN) group, the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus, the medial pulvinar (PuM), and the lateral nuclei group. The subcortical and cortical connectivity of these clusters revealed that: (1) the oblique cranio-caudal-oriented fibers of the AN cluster mainly connect to limbic structures, (2) the numerous dorso-frontal-oriented fibers of MD mainly project to the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobe, (3) the fibers of the PuM running in parallel with the x-axis project to medio-occipital and medio-temporal areas and connect visual areas with the hippocampus and amygdala and via intrathalamic pathways with medio-frontal areas, and (4) the oblique caudo-cranial fibers of the two lateral clusters located anteriorly in the motor and posteriorly in the sensory thalamus are routing sensory–motor information from the brain stem via the internal capsule to pre- and peri-central regions of the cortex.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studiesofemotion, personality, and social cognition have drawn much attention in recent years, with high-profile studies frequently reporting extremely high (e.g., {\textgreater}.8) correlations between brain activation and personality measures. We show that these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported findings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this nonindependent analysis inflates correlations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge authors to perform such reanalyses. The underlying problems described here appear to be common in fMRI research of many kinds—not just in studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition.},

The purpose of these studies is to see which areas of the brain are activated by the stimulation condition. In many cognitive studies, the activation is so slight that the experiment must be repeated on several subjects and the subtracted images are averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The averaged image is then standardized to have unit variance and then searched for local maxima. The main problem facing investigators is which of these local maxima are statistically significant. We describe a simple method for determining an approximate p value for the global maximum based on the theory of Gaussian random fields. The p value is proportional to the volume searched divided by the product of the full widths at half-maximum of the image reconstruction process or number of resolution elements. Rather than working with local maxima, our method focuses on the Euler characteristic of the set of voxels with a value larger than a given threshold. The Euler characteristic depends only on the topology of the regions of high activation, irrespective of their shape. For large threshold values this is approximately the same as the number of isolated regions of activation above the threshold. We can thus not only determine if any activation has taken place, but we can also estimate how many isolated regions of activation are present.},

Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that lifelong bilingualism may act as CR delaying the onset of dementia by ∼4.5 y. Much controversy surrounds the issue of bilingualism and its putative neuroprotective effects. We studied brain metabolism, a direct index of synaptic function and density, and neural connectivity to shed light on the effects of bilingualism in vivo in Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). Eighty-five patients with probable AD and matched for disease duration (45 German-Italian bilingual speakers and 40 monolingual speakers) were included. Notably, bilingual individuals were on average 5 y older than their monolingual peers. In agreement with our predictions and with models of CR, cerebral hypometabolism was more severe in the group of bilingual individuals with AD. The metabolic connectivity analyses crucially supported the neuroprotective effect of bilingualism by showing an increased connectivity in the executive control and the default mode networks in the bilingual, compared with the monolingual, AD patients. Furthermore, the degree of lifelong bilingualism (i.e., high, moderate, or low use) was significantly correlated to functional modulations in crucial neural networks, suggesting both neural reserve and compensatory mechanisms. These findings indicate that lifelong bilingualism acts as a powerful CR proxy in dementia and exerts neuroprotective effects against neurodegeneration. Delaying the onset of dementia is a top priority of modern societies, and the present in vivo neurobiological evidence should stimulate social programs and interventions to support bilingual or multilingual education and the maintenance of the second language among senior citizens.},

The aim of the study is to investigate sensorimotor network modifications in PME by assessing the relationship between neurophysiological findings and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation. Somatosensory-evoked potential (SSEP) obtained briefly before fMRI and BOLD activation during median-nerve electrical stimulation were recorded in four subjects with typical PME phenotype and compared with normative data. Giant scalp SSEPs with enlarger N20-P25 complex compared to normal data (mean amplitude of 26.2 ± 8.2 μV after right stimulation and 27.9 ± 3.7 μV after left stimulation) were detected. Statistical group analysis showed a reduced BOLD activation in response to median nerve stimulation in PMEs compared to controls over the sensorimotor (SM) areas and an increased response over subcortical regions (p {\textless} 0.01, Z {\textgreater} 2.3, corrected). PMEs show dissociation between neurophysiological and BOLD findings of SSEPs (giant SSEP with reduced BOLD activation over SM). A direct pathway connecting a highly restricted area of the somatosensory cortex with the thalamus can be hypothesized to support the higher excitability of these areas.},

Pairing a stimulus in one modality (vision) with a stimulus in another (sound) can lead to task-induced hallucinations in healthy individuals. After many trials, people eventually report perceiving a nonexistent stimulus contingent on the presence of the previously paired stimulus. Powers et al. investigated how different groups of volunteers and patients respond to this conditioning paradigm. They used behavior, neuroimaging, and computational modeling to dissect the effect of perceptual priors versus sensory evidence on such induced hallucinations. People who are more prone to hear voices were more susceptible to the induced auditory hallucinations. The network of brain regions that was active during the conditioned hallucinations resembled the network observed during clinical symptom capture in individuals who hallucinate while in a brain scanner.
Science, this issue p. 596
Some people hear voices that others do not, but only some of those people seek treatment. Using a Pavlovian learning task, we induced conditioned hallucinations in four groups of people who differed orthogonally in their voice-hearing and treatment-seeking statuses. People who hear voices were significantly more susceptible to the effect. Using functional neuroimaging and computational modeling of perception, we identified processes that differentiated voice-hearers from non–voice-hearers and treatment-seekers from non–treatment-seekers and characterized a brain circuit that mediated the conditioned hallucinations. These data demonstrate the profound and sometimes pathological impact of top-down cognitive processes on perception and may represent an objective means to discern people with a need for treatment from those without.
Perceptual beliefs, stimulus associations, and belief volatility drive task-induced hallucinations in voice-hearers.

	abstract = {Background
Mechanistically based neural markers such as amygdala reactivity offer one approach to addressing the challenges of differentiating bipolar and unipolar depressive disorders, independently from mood state and acute symptoms. Although emotion-elicited amygdala reactivity has been found to distinguish bipolar from unipolar patients in depressed states, it remains unknown whether this distinction is trait-like and present in the absence of an acutely depressed mood. We address this gap by investigating bipolar (BP) and unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) populations in remission.
Methods
73 participants (23 BP and 25 MDD patients matched for age-gender, number of depressive episodes and severity; 25 age-gender matched healthy individuals) completed supra- and subliminal processing of threat, sad, happy and neutral faces during fMRI. We compared groups for activation and connectivity for the amygdala.
Results
BP participants had lower left amygdala activation than MDD during supraliminal and subliminal threat, sad and neutral processing and for subliminal happy faces. BP participants also exhibited lower amygdala connectivity to the insula and hippocampus for threat and to medial orbito-frontal for happy supraliminal and subliminal processing. BP participants also demonstrated greater amygdala-insula connectivity for sad supraliminal and subliminal face processing. Both patient groups were distinct from controls across several measures for activation and connectivity.
Conclusion
Independent of valence or level of emotional awareness amygdala activation and connectivity during facial emotion processing can distinguish BP and MDD patients. These findings provide evidence that this neural substrate could be a potential trait-marker to differentiate these two disorders largely independent of illness state.},

	abstract = {Summary. Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

In this chronnectome study, we investigate the replicability of the human brain's inter-regional coupling dynamics during rest by evaluating two different dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis frameworks using 7 500 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. To quantify the extent to which the emergent functional connectivity (FC) patterns are reproducible, we characterize the temporal dynamics by deriving several summary measures across multiple large, independent age-matched samples. Reproducibility was demonstrated through the existence of basic connectivity patterns (FC states) amidst an ensemble of inter-regional connections. Furthermore, application of the methods to conservatively configured (statistically stationary, linear and Gaussian) surrogate datasets revealed that some of the studied state summary measures were indeed statistically significant and also suggested that this class of null model did not explain the fMRI data fully. This extensive testing of reproducibility of similarity statistics also suggests that the estimated FC states are robust against variation in data quality, analysis, grouping, and decomposition methods. We conclude that future investigations probing the functional and neurophysiological relevance of time-varying connectivity assume critical importance.},

	abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

Two different arguments are presented that demonstrate the irrelevance of SS to replicability: (a) SS may not be taken as a sign of the truth of the research hypothesis; and (b) statistical significance tests do not generate verifiable predictions of replication attempts. Direct tests of replicability and effect-size measures of replicability are shown to have comparable problems. A solution to the replicability problem is proposed for atheoretical research that replaces `once-and-for-all' tests of replicability with the requirement that the treatment effect be demonstrable (a) in the individual, (b) on a continuing basis, and (c) in a way that is clearly discernible.

	abstract = {As the field of psychology struggles to trust published findings, replication research has begun to become more of a priority to both scientists and journals. With this increasing emphasis placed on reproducibility, it is essential that replication studies be capable of advancing the field. However, we argue that many researchers have been only narrowly interpreting the meaning of replication, with studies being designed with a simple statistically significant or nonsignificant results framework in mind. Although this interpretation may be desirable in some cases, we develop a variety of additional “replication goals” that researchers could consider when planning studies. Even if researchers are aware of these goals, we show that they are rarely used in practice—as results are typically analyzed in a manner only appropriate to a simple significance test. We discuss each goal conceptually, explain appropriate analysis procedures, and provide 1 or more examples to illustrate these analyses in practice. We hope that these various goals will allow researchers to develop a more nuanced understanding of replication that can be flexible enough to answer the various questions that researchers might seek to understand.

	abstract = {A recent study of the replicability of key psychological findings is a major contribution toward understanding the human side of the scientific process. Despite the careful and nuanced analysis reported, the simple narrative disseminated by the mass, social, and scientific media was that in only 36\% of the studies were the original results replicated. In the current study, however, we showed that 77\% of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95\% prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers’ intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervals—and a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size (or existence) of the true effect. In this light, the results of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology can be viewed as statistically consistent with what one might expect when performing a large-scale replication experiment.},

	abstract = {Whole brain fMRI analyses rarely include the entire brain because of missing data that result from data acquisition limits and susceptibility artifact, in particular. This missing data problem is typically addressed by omitting voxels from analysis, which may exclude brain regions that are of theoretical interest and increase the potential for Type II error at cortical boundaries or Type I error when spatial thresholds are used to establish significance. Imputation could significantly expand statistical map coverage, increase power, and enhance interpretations of fMRI results. We examined multiple imputation for group level analyses of missing fMRI data using methods that leverage the spatial information in fMRI datasets for both real and simulated data. Available case analysis, neighbor replacement, and regression based imputation approaches were compared in a general linear model framework to determine the extent to which these methods quantitatively (effect size) and qualitatively (spatial coverage) increased the sensitivity of group analyses. In both real and simulated data analysis, multiple imputation provided 1) variance that was most similar to estimates for voxels with no missing data, 2) fewer false positive errors in comparison to mean replacement, and 3) fewer false negative errors in comparison to available case analysis. Compared to the standard analysis approach of omitting voxels with missing data, imputation methods increased brain coverage in this study by 35\% (from 33,323 to 45,071 voxels). In addition, multiple imputation increased the size of significant clusters by 58\% and number of significant clusters across statistical thresholds, compared to the standard voxel omission approach. While neighbor replacement produced similar results, we recommend multiple imputation because it uses an informed sampling distribution to deal with missing data across subjects that can include neighbor values and other predictors. Multiple imputation is anticipated to be particularly useful for 1) large fMRI data sets with inconsistent missing voxels across subjects and 2) addressing the problem of increased artifact at ultra-high field, which significantly limit the extent of whole brain coverage and interpretations of results.},

The statistic value itself, as a dimensionless measure, does not provide information on the biophysical interpretation of a study, and it certainly does not represent the whole picture of a study. Unfortunately, in contrast to standard practice in most scientific fields, effect (or amplitude) estimates are usually not provided in most results reporting in the current neuroimaging publications and presentations. Possible reasons underlying this general trend include (1) lack of general awareness, (2) software limitations, (3) inaccurate estimation of the BOLD response, and (4) poor modeling due to our relatively limited understanding of FMRI signal components. However, as we discuss here, such reporting damages the reliability and interpretability of the scientific findings themselves, and there is in fact no overwhelming reason for such a practice to persist. In order to promote meaningful interpretation, cross validation, reproducibility, meta and power analyses in neuroimaging, we strongly suggest that, as part of good scientific practice, effect estimates should be reported together with their corresponding statistic values. We provide several easily adaptable recommendations for facilitating this process.},

A clinically important challenge is to discover cancer subtypes and their molecular drivers in a comprehensive genetic context. Curtis et al. [Nature (2012) 486(7403):346–352] has recently shown that integrative clustering of copy number and gene expression in 2,000 breast tumors reveals novel subgroups beyond the classic expression subtypes that show distinct clinical outcomes. To extend the scope of integrative analysis for the inclusion of somatic mutation data by massively parallel sequencing, we propose a framework for joint modeling of discrete and continuous variables that arise from integrated genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling. The core idea is motivated by the hypothesis that diverse molecular phenotypes can be predicted by a set of orthogonal latent variables that represent distinct molecular drivers, and thus can reveal tumor subgroups of biological and clinical importance. Using the cancer cell line encyclopedia dataset, we demonstrate our method can accurately group cell lines by their cell-of-origin for several cancer types, and precisely pinpoint their known and potential cancer driver genes. Our integrative analysis also demonstrates the power for revealing subgroups that are not lineage-dependent, but consist of different cancer types driven by a common genetic alteration. Application of the cancer genome atlas colorectal cancer data reveals distinct integrated tumor subtypes, suggesting different genetic pathways in colon cancer progression.},

In this study, we use penalized latent variable regression methods for joint modeling of multiple omics data types to identify common latent variables that can be used to cluster patient samples into biologically and clinically relevant disease subtypes.

Moffitt et al. used a combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing and MERFISH (multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization) to map the identity and location of specific cell types within the mouse preoptic hypothalamus and surrounding areas of the brain (see the Perspective by Tasic and Nicovich). They related these cell types to specific behaviors via gene activity. The approach provides an unbiased description of cell types of the preoptic area, which are important for sleep, thermoregulation, thirst, and social behavior.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONA mechanistic understanding of brain function requires the identification of distinct cell types in the brain at a molecular, spatial, and functional level. The preoptic region of the hypothalamus comprises multiple nuclei and controls many social behaviors and homeostatic functions. Discrete neuronal types within the preoptic region have been associated with specific hypothalamic behaviors and homeostatic controls, yet the organizational principles of the underlying circuits remain elusive. Further progress requires methods that can identify molecularly distinct cell types and map their spatial and functional organization in the tissue.
RATIONALESingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the understanding of many tissues by allowing a systematic, genome-wide molecular identification of cell types. However, scRNA-seq requires cell dissociation, leading to a loss of spatial context that is essential to understand the cellular architecture of brain circuits. Image-based approaches to single-cell transcriptomics enables gene expression profiling of individual cells within their native tissue and offers opportunities for simultaneous in situ cell-type identification and spatial mapping, as well as functional characterization when combined with activity marker imaging. The combination of these complementary techniques would allow us to generate a molecular inventory of neuronal types while mapping their spatial and functional organization.
RESULTSWe combined scRNA-seq and multiplexed error robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-cell transcriptome imaging method, to investigate the molecular, spatial, and functional organization of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. We profiled {\textasciitilde}31,000 cells using scRNA-seq and imaged {\textasciitilde}1.1 million cells within intact tissues using MERFISH. Our data revealed a remarkable diversity of neurons in this region, comprising {\textasciitilde}70 different neuronal populations, many of which were previously unknown. These neuronal types exhibited distinct neuromodulatory signatures and revealed a striking heterogeneity within cell populations that were previously thought to be functionally unitary. MERFISH measurements further allowed us to map the spatial organization of these neuronal types, determine the cellular composition of distinct nuclei, and provide insights into the functional organization of neuron populations, including topographical relationships that underlie sex hormone signaling.Last, we combined MERFISH with immediate-early-gene expression imaging to identify specific neuronal populations activated by social behaviors, including parenting, mating, and aggression. Several neuronal populations were selectively activated in each of these behaviors, supporting the notion that transcriptionally distinct neuronal types control specific hypothalamic functions. We identified a core neuronal population activated in all animals that exhibit parenting, as well as cell populations differentially activated in mothers and fathers, providing insights into how physiological state may affect parental behavior. Moreover, we identified cells associated with sexual behavior in males and females as well as male aggression toward infants and conspecific males.
CONCLUSIONBy combining MERFISH with scRNA-seq, we have revealed the molecular, spatial, and functional organization of neurons within the hypothalamic preoptic region. These results provide a framework for mechanistic investigation of behavior circuits with high molecular and spatial resolution and opens avenues for identifying and mapping cell types in a diverse range of tissues and organisms. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6416/eaau5324/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint In situ single-cell profiling reveals the molecular and cellular organization of the hypothalamic preoptic region.The combination of MERFISH with scRNA-seq to profile the gene expression of 1 million cells in situ revealed {\textasciitilde}70 neuronal populations in the preoptic region, each with distinct molecular signatures and spatial organizations, providing insights into neuromodulatory signaling pathways. Further combination with activity marker imaging led to the identification of discrete neuronal types activated by key social behaviors, including parenting, aggression, and mating.
The hypothalamus controls essential social behaviors and homeostatic functions. However, the cellular architecture of hypothalamic nuclei—including the molecular identity, spatial organization, and function of distinct cell types—is poorly understood. Here, we developed an imaging-based in situ cell-type identification and mapping method and combined it with single-cell RNA-sequencing to create a molecularly annotated and spatially resolved cell atlas of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic region. We profiled {\textasciitilde}1 million cells, identified {\textasciitilde}70 neuronal populations characterized by distinct neuromodulatory signatures and spatial organizations, and defined specific neuronal populations activated during social behaviors in male and female mice, providing a high-resolution framework for mechanistic investigation of behavior circuits. The approach described opens a new avenue for the construction of cell atlases in diverse tissues and organisms.
A spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic study of an essential brain region yields a functionally annotated cell atlas.

Existing scRNA-seq analysis methods incorrectly assume that the composition of cell populations is either known or identical across batches. We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.},

Defining cell types requires integrating diverse single-cell measurements from multiple experiments and biological contexts. To flexibly model single-cell datasets, we developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity. We applied it to four diverse and challenging analyses of human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined region-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Second, we analyzed expression in the human substantia nigra, comparing cell states in specific donors and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we integrated in situ and single-cell expression data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we jointly defined mouse cortical cell types using single-cell RNA-seq and DNA methylation profiles, revealing putative mechanisms of cell-type-specific epigenomic regulation. Integrative analyses using LIGER promise to accelerate investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.},

	abstract = {The brain is the body's largest energy consumer, even in the absence of demanding tasks. Electrophysiologists report on-going neuronal firing during stimulation or task in regions beyond those of primary relationship to the perturbation. Although the biological origin of consciousness remains elusive, it is argued that it emerges from complex, continuous whole-brain neuronal collaboration. Despite converging evidence suggesting the whole brain is continuously working and adapting to anticipate and actuate in response to the environment, over the last 20 y, task-based functional MRI (fMRI) have emphasized a localizationist view of brain function, with fMRI showing only a handful of activated regions in response to task/stimulation. Here, we challenge that view with evidence that under optimal noise conditions, fMRI activations extend well beyond areas of primary relationship to the task; and blood-oxygen level-dependent signal changes correlated with task-timing appear in over 95\% of the brain for a simple visual stimulation plus attention control task. Moreover, we show that response shape varies substantially across regions, and that whole-brain parcellations based on those differences produce distributed clusters that are anatomically and functionally meaningful, symmetrical across hemispheres, and reproducible across subjects. These findings highlight the exquisite detail lying in fMRI signals beyond what is normally examined, and emphasize both the pervasiveness of false negatives, and how the sparseness of fMRI maps is not a result of localized brain function, but a consequence of high noise and overly strict predictive response models.},

	abstract = {The mass-univariate approach for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis remains a widely used statistical tool within neuroimaging. However, this method suffers from at least two fundamental limitations: First, with sufficient sample sizes there is high enough statistical power to reject the null hypothesis everywhere, making it difficult if not impossible to localize effects of interest. Second, with any sample size, when cluster-size inference is used a significant p-value only indicates that a cluster is larger than chance. Therefore, no notion of confidence is available to express the size or location of a cluster that could be expected with repeated sampling from the population. In this work, we address these issues by extending on a method proposed by Sommerfeld et al. (2018) (SSS) to develop spatial Confidence Sets (CSs) on clusters found in thresholded raw effect size maps. While hypothesis testing indicates where the null, i.e. a raw effect size of zero, can be rejected, the CSs give statements on the locations where raw effect sizes exceed, and fall short of, a non-zero threshold, providing both an upper and lower CS. While the method can be applied to any mass-univariate General Linear Model, we motivate the method in the context of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI contrast maps for inference on percentage BOLD change raw effects. We propose several theoretical and practical implementation advancements to the original method formulated in SSS, delivering a procedure with superior performance in sample sizes as low as N=60. We validate the method with 3D Monte Carlo simulations that resemble fMRI data. Finally, we compute CSs for the Human Connectome Project working memory task contrast images, illustrating the brain regions that show a reliable \%BOLD change for a given \%BOLD threshold.},

	abstract = {Background
There is considerable evidence that the thalamus is abnormal in psychotic disorders. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed an intriguing pattern of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis characterized by reduced prefrontal cortex (PFC) connectivity and increased somatomotor-thalamic connectivity. However, critical knowledge gaps remain with respect to the onset, anatomical specificity, and clinical correlates of thalamic dysconnectivity in psychosis.
Methods
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected on 105 healthy subjects and 148 individuals with psychosis, including 53 early-stage psychosis patients. Using all 253 subjects, the thalamus was parceled into functional regions of interest (ROIs) on the basis of connectivity with six a priori defined cortical ROIs covering most of the cortical mantle. Functional connectivity between each cortical ROI and its corresponding thalamic ROI was quantified and compared across groups. Significant differences in the ROI-to-ROI analysis were followed up with voxelwise seed-based analyses to further localize thalamic dysconnectivity.
Results
ROI analysis revealed reduced PFC-thalamic connectivity and increased somatomotor-thalamic connectivity in both chronic and early-stage psychosis patients. PFC hypoconnectivity and motor cortex hyperconnectivity correlated in patients, suggesting that they result from a common pathophysiological mechanism. Seed-based analyses revealed thalamic hypoconnectivity in psychosis localized to dorsolateral PFC, medial PFC, and cerebellar areas of the well-described executive control network. Across all subjects, thalamic connectivity with areas of the fronto-parietal network correlated with cognitive functioning, including verbal learning and memory.
Conclusions
Thalamocortical dysconnectivity is present in both chronic and early stages of psychosis, includes reduced thalamic connectivity with the executive control network, and is related to cognitive impairment.},

The least attractive of the options is the one currently most readily available in logistic regression software, the unstandardized coefficient divided by its standard error (which is actually the normal distribution version of the Wald statistic). One alternative has the advantage of simplicity, while a slightly more complex alternative most closely parallels the standardized coefficient in ordinary least squares regression, in the sense of being based on variance in the dependent variable and the predictors. The sixth alternative, based on information theory, may be the best from a conceptual standpoint, but unless and until appropriate algorithms are constructed to simplify its calculation, its use is limited to relatively simple logistic regression models in practical application.},

We propose an alternative, nonparametric MSM (NPMSM) approach that extends the definition of causal parameters of interest and causal effects. This approach is appealing in practice as it does not require correct specification of a parametric model but instead relies on a working model which can be willingly misspecified. We propose a methodology for longitudinal data to generate and estimate so-called NPMSM parameters describing so-called nonparametric causal effects and provide insight on how to interpret these parameters causally in practice. Results are illustrated with a point treatment simulation study. The proposed NPMSM approach to Causal Inference is compared to the more typical PMSM approach and we contribute to the general understanding of PMSM estimation by addressing the issue of PMSM misspecification.},

	abstract = {Reporting effect sizes in scientific articles is increasingly widespread and encouraged by journals; however, choosing an effect size for analyses such as mixed-effects regression modeling and hierarchical linear modeling can be difficult. One relatively uncommon, but very informative, standardized measure of effect size is Cohen’s f2, which allows an evaluation of local effect size, i.e., one variable’s effect size within the context of a multivariate regression model. Unfortunately, this measure is often not readily accessible from commonly used software for repeated-measures or hierarchical data analysis. In this guide, we illustrate how to extract Cohen’s f2 for two variables within a mixed-effects regression model using PROC MIXED in SAS® software. Two examples of calculating Cohen’s f2 for different research questions are shown, using data from a longitudinal cohort study of smoking development in adolescents. This tutorial is designed to facilitate the calculation and reporting of effect sizes for single variables within mixed-effects multiple regression models, and is relevant for analyses of repeated-measures or hierarchical/multilevel data that are common in experimental psychology, observational research, and clinical or intervention studies.},

The usual practice is to couple it with an asymptotically valid estimation of its covariance matrix, and then carry out hypothesis tests that are valid under heteroskedasticity of unknown form. We use numerical integration methods to compute the exact null distributions of some quasi-t test statistics, and propose a new covariance matrix estimator.

In the present work, we take on various critiques of our work and further explore the limitations of our original work. We address issues about the particular event-related designs we used, considering multiple event types and randomization of events between subjects. We consider the lack of validity found with one-sample permutation (sign flipping) tests, investigating a number of approaches to improve the false positive control of this widely used procedure. We found that the combination of a two-sided test and cleaning the data using ICA FIX resulted in nominal false positive rates for all data sets, meaning that data cleaning is not only important for resting state fMRI, but also for task fMRI. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work on the fMRI literature as a whole, estimating that at least 10\% of the fMRI studies have used the most problematic cluster inference method (p = .01 cluster defining threshold), and how individual studies can be interpreted in light of our findings. These additional results underscore our original conclusions, on the importance of data sharing and thorough evaluation of statistical methods on realistic null data.},

The book is aimed a a graduate level audience who has some exposure to the methods of theoretical statistics. However, technical details are delayed until the last chapter (entitled "Details of Mathematical Rogour"), and so a mathematically able reader without knowledge of the rigorous theory of probability will have no trouble understanding the first four-fifths of the book.

The simulation results in the literature suggest that some of these methods work quite well in practice; the theoretical results are limited and more mixed in their conclusions. For example, McCullagh reached negative conclusions about the use of non-parametric bootstraps for one-way arrays. The purpose of this paper is to extend our understanding of the issues by discussing the effect of different ways of modelling clustered data, the criteria for successful bootstraps used in the literature and extending the theory from functions of the sample mean to include functions of the between and within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps to include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the consistency of variance estimates for a bootstrap method depends on the choice of model with the residual bootstrap giving consistency under the transformation model whereas the cluster bootstrap gives consistent estimates under both the transformation and the random-effect model. In addition we note that the criteria based on the distribution of the bootstrap observations are not really useful in assessing consistency.},

Further, we establish consistency of the modified bootstrap method for estimating the asymptotic bias and variance of the Lasso estimator. We also show that the residual bootstrap can be used to consistently estimate the distribution and variance of the adaptive Lasso estimator. Using the former result, we formulate a novel data-based method for choosing the optimal penalizing parameter for the Lasso using the modified bootstrap.

Even when effect size is incorporated into RCT research the recommendations of whether interventions are effective are misleading and generally useless to practitioners. As a result, a new criterion of practical benefit is recommended for evaluating research findings about the effectiveness of interventions in complex organizations where benchmarks of existing performance exist. Practical benefit exists when the unadjusted performance of an experimental group provides a noticeable advantage over an existing benchmark. Some basic principles for determining practical benefit are provided. Practical benefit is more intuitive and is expected to enable leaders to make more accurate assessments as to whether published research findings are likely to produce noticeable improvements in their organizations. In addition, practical benefit is used routinely as the research criterion for the alternative scientific methodology of improvement science that has an established track record of being a more efficient way to develop new interventions that improve practice dramatically than RCT research. Finally, the problems with practical significance suggest that the research community should seek different inferential methods for research designed to improve clinical performance in complex organizations, as compared to methods for testing theories and medicines.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for in vivo detection and characterization of white matter lesions (WML) in multiple sclerosis (MS). The most widely established MRI outcome measure is the volume of hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images (T2L). Unfortunately, T2L are non-specific for the level of tissue destruction and show a weak relationship to clinical status. Interest in lesions appearing hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1L) (“black holes”), which provide more specificity for axonal loss and a closer link to neurologic disability, has thus grown. The technical difficulty of T1L segmentation has led investigators to rely on time-consuming manual assessments prone to inter- and intra-rater variability. We implement MIMoSA, a current T2L automatic segmentation approach, to delineate T1L. Using cross-validation, MIMoSA proved robust for segmenting both T2L and T1L. For T2L, a Sørensen-Dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.6 and partial AUC (pAUC) up to 1\% false positive rate of 0.69 were achieved. For T1L, 0.48 DSC and 0.63 pAUC were achieved. The correlation between EDSS and manual versus automatic volumes were similar for T1L (0.32 manual vs. 0.34 MIMoSA) and T2L (0.34 vs. 0.34).},

This concept is often used for measurement of model complexity, for obtaining an unbiased estimate of the error variance, and for comparison of different models.

The definition is based on the sum of the sensitivity of each fitted value to perturbation in the corresponding observed value. The concept is nonasymptotic in nature and does not require analytic knowledge of the modeling procedures. The concept of GDF offers a unified framework under which complex and highly irregular modeling procedures can be analyzed in the same way as classical linear models. By using this framework, many difficult problems can be solved easily. For example, one can now measure the number of observations used in a variable selection process. Different modeling procedures, such as a tree-based regression and a projection pursuit regression, can be compared on the basis of their residual sums of squares and the GDF that they cost. I apply the proposed framework to measure the effect of variable selection in linear models, leading to corrections of selection bias in various goodness-of-fit statistics. The theory also has interesting implications for the effect of general model searching by a human modeler.]},

INTRODUCTIONThe brain is responsible for cognition, behavior, and much of what makes us uniquely human. The development of the brain is a highly complex process, and this process is reliant on precise regulation of molecular and cellular events grounded in the spatiotemporal regulation of the transcriptome. Disruption of this regulation can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders.
RATIONALEThe regulatory, epigenomic, and transcriptomic features of the human brain have not been comprehensively compiled across time, regions, or cell types. Understanding the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders requires knowledge not just of endpoint differences between healthy and diseased brains but also of the developmental and cellular contexts in which these differences arise. Moreover, an emerging body of research indicates that many aspects of the development and physiology of the human brain are not well recapitulated in model organisms, and therefore it is necessary that neuropsychiatric disorders be understood in the broader context of the developing and adult human brain.
RESULTSHere we describe the generation and analysis of a variety of genomic data modalities at the tissue and single-cell levels, including transcriptome, DNA methylation, and histone modifications across multiple brain regions ranging in age from embryonic development through adulthood. We observed a widespread transcriptomic transition beginning during late fetal development and consisting of sharply decreased regional differences. This reduction coincided with increases in the transcriptional signatures of mature neurons and the expression of genes associated with dendrite development, synapse development, and neuronal activity, all of which were temporally synchronous across neocortical areas, as well as myelination and oligodendrocytes, which were asynchronous. Moreover, genes including MEF2C, SATB2, and TCF4, with genetic associations to multiple brain-related traits and disorders, converged in a small number of modules exhibiting spatial or spatiotemporal specificity.
CONCLUSIONWe generated and applied our dataset to document transcriptomic and epigenetic changes across human development and then related those changes to major neuropsychiatric disorders. These data allowed us to identify genes, cell types, gene coexpression modules, and spatiotemporal loci where disease risk might converge, demonstrating the utility of the dataset and providing new insights into human development and disease. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6420/eaat7615/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain development and neuropsychiatric risks.Human brain development begins during embryonic development and continues through adulthood (top).

To broaden our understanding of human neurodevelopment, we profiled transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes across brain regions and/or cell types for the entire span of prenatal and postnatal development. Integrative analysis revealed temporal, regional, sex, and cell type–specific dynamics. We observed a global transcriptomic cup-shaped pattern, characterized by a late fetal transition associated with sharply decreased regional differences and changes in cellular composition and maturation, followed by a reversal in childhood-adolescence, and accompanied by epigenomic reorganizations. Analysis of gene coexpression modules revealed relationships with epigenomic regulation and neurodevelopmental processes. Genes with genetic associations to brain-based traits and neuropsychiatric disorders (including MEF2C, SATB2, SOX5, TCF4, and TSHZ3) converged in a small number of modules and distinct cell types, revealing insights into neurodevelopment and the genomic basis of neuropsychiatric risks.},

However, each of these methods presents unique limitations. To generate a more confident and comprehensive view of the complex genetics underlying aggression, we undertook an integrated, cross-species approach. We focused on human and rodent models to derive eight gene lists from three main categories of genetic evidence: two sets of genes identified in GWAS studies, four sets implicated by transcriptome-wide studies of rodent models, and two sets of genes with causal evidence from online Mendelian inheritance in man (OMIM) and knockout (KO) mice reports. These gene sets were evaluated for overlap and pathway enrichment to extract their similarities and differences. We identified enriched common pathways such as the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway, axon guidance, reelin signaling in neurons, and ERK/MAPK signaling. Also, individual genes were ranked based on their cumulative weights to quantify their importance as risk factors for aggressive behavior, which resulted in 40 top-ranked and highly interconnected genes. The results of our cross-species and integrated approach provide insights into the genetic etiology of aggression.},

	abstract = {Shifts in brain regions with brain size
Brain size among normal humans varies as much as twofold. Reardon et al. surveyed the cortical and subcortical structure of more than 3000 human brains by noninvasive imaging (see the Perspective by Van Essen). They found that the scaling of different regions across the range of brain sizes is not consistent: Some brain regions are metabolically costly and are favored in larger brains. This shifts the balance between associative and sensorimotor brain systems in a brain size–dependent way.
Science, this issue p. 1222; see also p. 1184
Brain size variation over primate evolution and human development is associated with shifts in the proportions of different brain regions. Individual brain size can vary almost twofold among typically developing humans, but the consequences of this for brain organization remain poorly understood. Using in vivo neuroimaging data from more than 3000 individuals, we find that larger human brains show greater areal expansion in distributed frontoparietal cortical networks and related subcortical regions than in limbic, sensory, and motor systems. This areal redistribution recapitulates cortical remodeling across evolution, manifests by early childhood in humans, and is linked to multiple markers of heightened metabolic cost and neuronal connectivity. Thus, human brain shape is systematically coupled to naturally occurring variations in brain size through a scaling map that integrates spatiotemporally diverse aspects of neurobiology.
A metabolically expensive brain network is preferentially expanded in individuals that have larger brains.

	abstract = {Such is the grip of formal methods of statistical inference—that is, frequentist methods for generalizing from sample to population in enumerative studies—in the drawing of scientific inferences that the two are routinely deemed equivalent in the social, management, and biomedical sciences. This, despite the fact that legitimate employment of said methods is difficult to implement on practical grounds alone. But supposing the adoption of these procedures were simple does not get us far; crucially, methods of formal statistical inference are ill-suited to the analysis of much scientific data. Even findings from the claimed gold standard for examination by the latter, randomized controlled trials, can be problematic.Scientific inference is a far broader concept than statistical inference. Its authority derives from the accumulation, over an extensive period of time, of both theoretical and empirical knowledge that has won the (provisional) acceptance of the scholarly community. A major focus of scientific inference can be viewed as the pursuit of significant sameness, meaning replicable and empirically generalizable results among phenomena. Regrettably, the obsession with users of statistical inference to report significant differences in data sets actively thwarts cumulative knowledge development.The manifold problems surrounding the implementation and usefulness of formal methods of statistical inference in advancing science do not speak well of much teaching in methods/statistics classes. Serious reflection on statistics' role in producing viable knowledge is needed. Commendably, the American Statistical Association is committed to addressing this challenge, as further witnessed in this special online, open access issue of The American Statistician.},

Estimating such regions so that the probability for exceeding the level in the entire set is equal to some predefined value is a difficult problem connected to the problem of multiple significance testing. In this work, a method for solving this problem, as well as the related problem of finding credible regions for contour curves, for latent Gaussian models is proposed. The method is based on using a parametric family for the excursion sets in combination with a sequential importance sampling method for estimating joint probabilities. The accuracy of the method is investigated by using simulated data and an environmental application is presented.},

Today, no standardized computational tools exist for the analysis of LNI data and widely used methods are sub-optimal for the types of data encountered in real-life studies. Linear Mixed Effects (LME) modeling, a mature approach well known in the statistics community, offers a powerful and versatile framework for analyzing real-life LNI data. This article presents the theory behind LME models, contrasts it with other popular approaches in the context of LNI, and is accompanied with an array of computational tools that will be made freely available through FreeSurfer — a popular Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) analysis software package. Our core contribution is to provide a quantitative empirical evaluation of the performance of LME and competing alternatives popularly used in prior longitudinal structural MRI studies, namely repeated measures ANOVA and the analysis of annualized longitudinal change measures (e.g. atrophy rate). In our experiments, we analyzed MRI-derived longitudinal hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness measurements from a public dataset consisting of Alzheimer's patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. Our results suggest that the LME approach offers superior statistical power in detecting longitudinal group differences.},

	abstract = {This article proposes the image intraclass correlation (I2C2) coefficient as a global measure of reliability for imaging studies. The I2C2 generalizes the classic intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficient to the case when the data of interest are images, thereby providing a measure that is both intuitive and convenient. Drawing a connection with classical measurement error models for replication experiments, the I2C2 can be computed quickly, even in high-dimensional imaging studies. A nonparametric bootstrap procedure is introduced to quantify the variability of the I2C2 estimator. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo permutation is utilized to test reproducibility versus a zero I2C2, representing complete lack of reproducibility. Methodologies are applied to three replication studies arising from different brain imaging modalities and settings: regional analysis of volumes in normalized space imaging for characterizing brain morphology, seed-voxel brain activation maps based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and fractional anisotropy in an area surrounding the corpus callosum via diffusion tensor imaging. Notably, resting-state fMRI brain activation maps are found to have low reliability, ranging from .2 to .4. Software and data are available to provide easy access to the proposed methods.},

Current statistical methods tend to localize fROIs inconsistently, focusing on avoiding detection of false activation. Not missing true activation is however equally important in this context. In this study, we explored the potential of an alternative-based thresholding (ABT) procedure, where evidence against the null hypothesis of no effect and evidence against a prespecified alternative hypothesis is measured to control both false positives and false negatives directly. The procedure was validated in the context of localizer tasks on simulated brain images and using a real data set of 100 runs per subject. Voxels categorized as active with ABT can be confidently included in the definition of the fROI, while inactive voxels can be confidently excluded. Additionally, the ABT method complements classic null hypothesis significance testing with valuable information by making a distinction between voxels that show evidence against both the null and alternative and voxels for which the alternative hypothesis cannot be rejected despite lack of evidence against the null.},

For example, the traditionally defined partial Spearman's correlation does not have a sensible population parameter, and the conditional Spearman's correlation defined with copulas cannot be easily generalized to discrete variables. We define population parameters for both partial and conditional Spearman's correlation through concordance–discordance probabilities. The definitions are natural extensions of Spearman's rank correlation in the presence of covariates and are general for any orderable random variables. We show that they can be neatly expressed using probability-scale residuals (PSRs). This connection allows us to derive simple estimators. Our partial estimator for Spearman's correlation between X and Y adjusted for Z is the correlation of PSRs from models of X on Z and of Y on Z, which is analogous to the partial Pearson's correlation derived as the correlation of observed-minus-expected residuals. Our conditional estimator is the conditional correlation of PSRs. We describe estimation and inference, and highlight the use of semiparametric cumulative probability models, which allow preservation of the rank-based nature of Spearman's correlation. We conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of our estimators and compare them with other popular measures of association, demonstrating their robustness and efficiency. We illustrate our method in two applications, a biomarker study and a large survey.},

Specifically, we establish conditions under which the distribution of the maximum is approximated by that of the maximum of a sum of the Gaussian random vectors with the same covariance matrices as the original vectors. This result applies when the dimension of random vectors (ppp) is large compared to the sample size (nnn); in fact, ppp can be much larger than nnn, without restricting correlations of the coordinates of these vectors. We also show that the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the random vectors with unknown covariance matrices can be consistently estimated by the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the conditional Gaussian random vectors obtained by multiplying the original vectors with i.i.d. Gaussian multipliers. This is the Gaussian multiplier (or wild) bootstrap procedure. Here too, ppp can be large or even much larger than nnn. These distributional approximations, either Gaussian or conditional Gaussian, yield a high-quality approximation to the distribution of the original maximum, often with approximation error decreasing polynomially in the sample size, and hence are of interest in many applications. We demonstrate how our Gaussian approximations and the multiplier bootstrap can be used for modern high-dimensional estimation, multiple hypothesis testing, and adaptive specification testing. All these results contain nonasymptotic bounds on approximation errors.},

	abstract = {Under weak and reasonable assumptions, mainly that data are exchangeable under the null hypothesis, permutation tests can provide exact control of false positives and allow the use of various non-standard statistics. There are, however, various common examples in which global exchangeability can be violated, including paired tests, tests that involve repeated measurements, tests in which subjects are relatives (members of pedigrees) — any dataset with known dependence among observations. In these cases, some permutations, if performed, would create data that would not possess the original dependence structure, and thus, should not be used to construct the reference (null) distribution. To allow permutation inference in such cases, we test the null hypothesis using only a subset of all otherwise possible permutations, i.e., using only the rearrangements of the data that respect exchangeability, thus retaining the original joint distribution unaltered. In a previous study, we defined exchangeability for blocks of data, as opposed to each datum individually, then allowing permutations to happen within block, or the blocks as a whole to be permuted. Here we extend that notion to allow blocks to be nested, in a hierarchical, multi-level definition. We do not explicitly model the degree of dependence between observations, only the lack of independence; the dependence is implicitly accounted for by the hierarchy and by the permutation scheme. The strategy is compatible with heteroscedasticity and variance groups, and can be used with permutations, sign flippings, or both combined. We evaluate the method for various dependence structures, apply it to real data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) as an example application, show that false positives can be avoided in such cases, and provide a software implementation of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {When a likelihood ratio is used to measure the strength of evidence for one hypothesis over another, its reliability (i.e. how often it produces misleading evidence) depends on the specification of the working model. When the working model happens to be the ‘true’ or ‘correct’ model, the probability of observing strong misleading evidence is low and controllable. But this is not necessarily the case when the working model is misspecified. Royall and Tsou (J. R. Stat. Soc., Ser. B 2003; 65:391–404) show how to adjust working models to make them robust to misspecification. Likelihood ratios derived from their ‘robust adjusted likelihood’ are just as reliable (asymptotically) as if the working model were correctly specified in the first place. In this paper, we apply and extend these ideas to the generalized linear model (GLM) regression setting. We provide several illustrations (both from simulated data and real data concerning rates of parasitic infection in Philippine adolescents), show how the required adjustment factor can be obtained from standard statistical software, and draw some connections between this approach and the ‘sandwich estimator’ for robust standard errors of regression parameters.

	abstract = {Summary. The strength of statistical evidence is measured by the likelihood ratio. Two key performance properties of this measure are the probability of observing strong misleading evidence and the probability of observing weak evidence. For the likelihood function associated with a parametric statistical model, these probabilities have a simple large sample structure when the model is correct. Here we examine how that structure changes when the model fails. This leads to criteria for determining whether a given likelihood function is robust (continuing to perform satisfactorily when the model fails), and to a simple technique for adjusting both likelihoods and profile likelihoods to make them robust. We prove that the expected information in the robust adjusted likelihood cannot exceed the expected information in the likelihood function from a true model. We note that the robust adjusted likelihood is asymptotically fully efficient when the working model is correct, and we show that in some important examples this efficiency is retained even when the working model fails. In such cases the Bayes posterior probability distribution based on the adjusted likelihood is robust, remaining correct asymptotically even when the model for the observable random variable does not include the true distribution. Finally we note a link to standard frequentist methodology?in large samples the adjusted likelihood functions provide robust likelihood-based confidence intervals.},

	abstract = {The human cortex is highly folded to allow for a massive expansion of surface area. Notably, the thickness of the cortex strongly depends on cortical topology, with gyral cortex sometimes twice as thick as sulcal cortex. We recently demonstrated that global differences in thickness between gyral and sulcal cortex continue to evolve throughout adolescence. However, human cortical development is spatially heterogeneous, and global comparisons lack power to detect localized differences in development or psychopathology. Here we extend previous work by proposing a new measure – local cortical coupling – that is sensitive to differences in the localized topological relationship between cortical thickness and sulcal depth. After estimation, subject-level coupling maps can be analyzed using standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Capitalizing on a large cross-sectional sample (n=932) of youth imaged as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we demonstrate that local coupling is spatially heterogeneous and exhibits nonlinear development-related trajectories. Moreover, we uncover sex differences in coupling that indicate divergent patterns of cortical topology. Developmental changes and sex differences in coupling support its potential as a neuroimaging phenotype for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders that are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. R code to estimate subject-level coupling maps from any two cortical surfaces generated by FreeSurfer is made publicly available along with this manuscript.},

We apply this approach, implemented in our R toolkit Seurat (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), to align scRNA-seq data sets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced using two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell 'atlases' generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across data sets, while boosting statistical power through integrated analysis. Our approach facilitates general comparisons of scRNA-seq data sets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.},

The observation points are assigned to the data space to observe the clusters through the distributions of the distances between the observation points and the objects in the dataset. A Gamma Mixture Model (GMM) is built from a distance distribution to partition the dataset into subsets, and a GMM tree is obtained by recursively partitioning the dataset. From the leaves of the GMM tree, a set of initial cluster centers are identified and the true number of clusters is estimated. This method is implemented in the new GMM-Tree algorithm. Two GMM forest algorithms are further proposed to ensemble multiple GMM trees to handle high dimensional data with many clusters. The GMM-P-Forest algorithm builds GMM trees in parallel, whereas the GMM-S-Forest algorithm uses a sequential process to build a GMM forest. Experiments were conducted on 32 synthetic datasets and 15 real datasets to evaluate the performance of the new algorithms. The results have shown that the proposed algorithms outperformed the existing popular methods: Silhouette, Elbow and Gap Statistic, and the recent method I-nice in estimating the true number of clusters from high dimensional complex data.},

This often requires compilation of results from multiple samples. Quantitative integration of information between samples is complicated by variations in staining intensity and background fluorescence due to differences in fixation and staining between samples, and other technical artefacts that obscure biological variations. Failure to remove these unwanted artefacts will complicate downstream analysis and diminish the value of multiplexed imaging for clinical applications. Here, we describe a \textbf{R}obust int\textbf{E}n\textbf{S}i\textbf{T}y n\textbf{OR}malization m\textbf{E}thod (\textbf{RESTORE}) to compensate for unwanted variations in multiplexed imaging. To do this, first, we automatically identify negative control cells for each marker within the same tissue and then use their expression levels to infer background signal level. Second, the intensity profile is normalized by the inferred background level of the negative control cells to remove between-sample variation. We evaluated the performance with theoretical simulations and tested the method using two different datasets; one comprised of multiplex images of three adjacent sections cut from a tissue microarray (TMA) carrying 59 cores from separate breast cancers and stained on different days, and one comprised of a pair of longitudinal biopsies obtained from one patient where tissue biopsy, fixation, processing and multiplexed staining/imaging were done at different times. We demonstrate that \textbf{RESTORE} can remove unwanted variations effectively and shows robust performance.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Because of the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, identifying a statistical test that is both valid and maximally sensitive is an important challenge. Here, we present a combination of two approaches for fMRI data analysis that together result in substantial improvements of the sensitivity of cluster-based statistics. The first approach is to create novel cluster definitions that are sensitive to physiologically plausible effect patterns. The second is to adopt a new approach to combine test statistics with different sensitivity profiles, which we call the min(p) method. These innovations are made possible by using the randomization inference framework. In this paper, we report on a set of simulations that demonstrate (1) that the proposed methods control the false-alarm rate, (2) that the sensitivity profiles of cluster-based test statistics vary depending on the cluster defining thresholds and cluster definitions, and (3) that the min(p) method for combining these test statistics results in a drastic increase of sensitivity (up to five-fold), compared to existing fMRI analysis methods. This increase in sensitivity is not at the expense of the spatial specificity of the inference.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Pioneering work in human neuroscience has relied on the ability to map brain function using task-based fMRI, but the empirical validity of these inferential methods is still being characterized. A recent landmark study by Eklund and colleagues showed that popular multiple comparison corrections based on cluster extent suffer from unexpectedly low specificity (i.e., high false positive rate). Yet that study’s focus on specificity, while important, is incomplete. The validity of a method depends also on its sensitivity (i.e., true positive rate or power), yet the sensitivity of cluster correction remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed the sensitivity of gold-standard nonparametric cluster correction by resampling real data from five tasks in the Human Connectome Project and comparing results with those from the full “ground truth” datasets (n ​= ​480–493). Critically, we found that sensitivity after correction is lower than may be practical for many fMRI applications. In particular, sensitivity to medium-sized effects ({\textbar}Cohen’s d{\textbar} ​= ​0.5) was less than 20\% across tasks on average, about three times smaller than without any correction. Furthermore, cluster extent correction exhibited a spatial bias in sensitivity that was independent of effect size. In comparison, correction based on the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) statistic approximately doubled sensitivity across tasks but increased spatial bias. These results suggest that we have, until now, only measured the tip of the iceberg in the activation-mapping literature due to our goal of limiting the familywise error rate through cluster extent-based inference. There is a need to revise our practices to improve sensitivity; we therefore conclude with a list of modern strategies to boost sensitivity while maintaining respectable specificity in future investigations.},

As with many other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting the need of correcting for site effects before performing downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization, may be counter-productive and negatively impacts the inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by site.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}To acquire larger samples for answering complex questions in neuroscience, researchers have increasingly turned to multi-site neuroimaging studies. However, these studies are hindered by differences in images acquired across multiple scanners. These effects have been shown to bias comparison between scanners, mask biologically meaningful associations, and even introduce spurious associations. To address this, the field has focused on harmonizing data by removing scanner-related effects in the mean and variance of measurements. Contemporaneously with the increase in popularity of multi-center imaging, the use of multivariate pattern analysis has also become commonplace. These approaches have been shown to provide improved sensitivity, specificity, and power due to their modeling the joint relationship across measurements in the brain. In this work, we demonstrate that the currently available methods for removing scanner effects are inherently insufficient for MVPA. This stems from the fact that no currently available harmonization approach has addressed how correlations between measurements can vary across scanners. Data from the Alzheimer9s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is used to show that considerable differences in covariance exist across scanners and that the state-of-the-art harmonization techniques do not address this issue. We also propose a novel methodology that harmonizes covariance of multivariate image measurements across scanners and demonstrate its improved performance in data harmonization, which further facilitates more power for detection of clinically relevant associations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Importance: United States government personnel experienced potential exposures to uncharacterized directional phenomena while serving in Havana, Cuba, from late 2016 through May 2018. The underlying neuroanatomical findings have not been described.
Objective: To examine potential differences in brain tissue volume, microstructure, and functional connectivity in government personnel compared with individuals not exposed to directional phenomena.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Forty government personnel (patients) who were potentially exposed and experienced neurological symptoms underwent evaluation at a US academic medical center from August 21, 2017, to June 8, 2018, including advanced structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging analytics. Findings were compared with imaging findings of 48 demographically similar healthy controls.
Exposures: Potential exposure to uncharacterized directional phenomena of unknown etiology, manifesting as pressure, vibration, or sound.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Potential imaging-based differences between patients and controls with regard to (1) white matter and gray matter total and regional brain volumes, (2) cerebellar tissue microstructure metrics (eg, mean diffusivity), and (3) functional connectivity in the visuospatial, auditory, and executive control subnetworks.
Results: Imaging studies were completed for 40 patients (mean age, 40.4 years; 23 [57.5\%] men; imaging performed a median of 188 [range, 4-403] days after initial exposure) and 48 controls (mean age, 37.6 years; 33 [68.8\%] men). Mean whole brain white matter volume was significantly smaller in patients compared with controls (patients: 542.22 cm3; controls: 569.61 cm3; difference, -27.39 [95\% CI, -37.93 to -16.84] cm3; P {\textless} .001), with no significant difference in the whole brain gray matter volume (patients: 698.55 cm3; controls: 691.83 cm3; difference, 6.72 [95\% CI, -4.83 to 18.27] cm3; P = .25). Among patients compared with controls, there were significantly greater ventral diencephalon and cerebellar gray matter volumes and significantly smaller frontal, occipital, and parietal lobe white matter volumes; significantly lower mean diffusivity in the inferior vermis of the cerebellum (patients: 7.71 × 10-4 mm2/s; controls: 8.98 × 10-4 mm2/s; difference, -1.27 × 10-4 [95\% CI, -1.93 × 10-4 to -6.17 × 10-5] mm2/s; P {\textless} .001); and significantly lower mean functional connectivity in the auditory subnetwork (patients: 0.45; controls: 0.61; difference, -0.16 [95\% CI, -0.26 to -0.05]; P = .003) and visuospatial subnetwork (patients: 0.30; controls: 0.40; difference, -0.10 [95\% CI, -0.16 to -0.04]; P = .002) but not in the executive control subnetwork (patients: 0.24; controls: 0.25; difference: -0.016 [95\% CI, -0.04 to 0.01]; P = .23).
Conclusions and Relevance: Among US government personnel in Havana, Cuba, with potential exposure to directional phenomena, compared with healthy controls, advanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant differences in whole brain white matter volume, regional gray and white matter volumes, cerebellar tissue microstructural integrity, and functional connectivity in the auditory and visuospatial subnetworks but not in the executive control subnetwork. The clinical importance of these differences is uncertain and may require further study.},

Critically, we present and validate a methodology for harmonizing this pooled dataset in the presence of nonlinear age trends. We provide a web-based visualization interface to generate and present the resulting age trends, enabling future studies of brain structure to compare their data with this reference of brain development and aging, and to examine deviations from ranges, potentially related to disease.},

	abstract = {This article constructs simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) for functional parameters using the Gaussian Kinematic formula of \$t\$-processes (tGKF). Although the tGKF relies on Gaussianity, we show that a central limit theorem (CLT) for the parameter of interest is enough to obtain asymptotically precise covering rates even for non-Gaussian processes. As a proof of concept we study the functional signal-plus-noise model and derive a CLT for an estimator of the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, the only data dependent quantities in the tGKF SCBs. Extensions to discrete sampling with additive observation noise are discussed using scale space ideas from regression analysis. Here we provide sufficient conditions on the processes and kernels to obtain convergence of the functional scale space surface. The theoretical work is accompanied by a simulation study comparing different methods to construct SCBs for the population mean. We show that the tGKF works well even for small sample sizes and only a Rademacher multiplier-\$t\$ bootstrap performs similarily well. For larger sample sizes the tGKF often outperforms the bootstrap methods and is computational faster. We apply the method to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fibers using a scale space approach for the difference of population means. R code is available in our Rpackage SCBfda.},

Our recommendation is to transform, then impute—i.e., calculate the interactions or squares in the incomplete data and then impute these transformations like any other variable. The transform-then-impute method yields good regression estimates, even though the imputed values are often inconsistent with one another. It is tempting to try and “fix” the inconsistencies in the imputed values, but methods that do so lead to biased regression estimates.

Substantively, a researcher can draw categorically different conclusions about null hypothesis rejection, estimation precision, and missing information in distinct multiple imputation runs for the same data and analysis with few imputations. This article explores the factors associated with this imprecision, demonstrates that precision improves by increasing the number of imputations, and provides practical guidelines for choosing a reasonable number of imputations to reduce imprecision for each of these quantities.},

The functional connectivity approaches do not directly provide information of the amplitude of brain activity of each brain region within a network. Alternatively, an index named amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the resting-state fMRI signal has been suggested to reflect the intensity of regional spontaneous brain activity. However, it has been indicated that the ALFF is also sensitive to the physiological noise. The current study proposed a fractional ALFF (fALFF) approach, i.e., the ratio of power spectrum of low-frequency (0.01–0.08Hz) to that of the entire frequency range and this approach was tested in two groups of resting-state fMRI data. The results showed that the brain areas within the default mode network including posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior parietal lobule had significantly higher fALFF than the other brain areas. This pattern was consistent with previous neuroimaging results. The non-specific signal components in the cistern areas in resting-state fMRI were significantly suppressed, indicating that the fALFF approach improved the sensitivity and specificity in detecting spontaneous brain activities. Its mechanism and sensitivity to abnormal brain activity should be evaluated in the future studies.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in deciphering mechanisms of human brain cortical folding leave unexplained whether spatially patterned genetic influences contribute to this folding. High-resolution in vivo brain MRI can be used to estimate genetic correlations (covariability due to shared genetic factors) in interregional cortical thickness, and biomechanical studies predict an influence of cortical thickness on folding patterns. However, progress has been hampered because shared genetic influences related to folding patterns likely operate at a scale that is much more local ({\textless}1 cm) than that addressed in prior imaging studies. Here, we develop methodological approaches to examine local genetic influences on cortical thickness and apply these methods to two large, independent samples. We find that such influences are markedly heterogeneous in strength, and in some cortical areas are notably stronger in specific orientations relative to gyri or sulci. The overall, phenotypic local correlation has a significant basis in shared genetic factors and is highly symmetric between left and right cortical hemispheres. Furthermore, the degree of local cortical folding relates systematically with the strength of local correlations, which tends to be higher in gyral crests and lower in sulcal fundi. The relationship between folding and local correlations is stronger in primary sensorimotor areas and weaker in association areas such as prefrontal cortex, consistent with reduced genetic constraints on the structural topology of association cortex. Collectively, our results suggest that patterned genetic influences on cortical thickness, measurable at the scale of in vivo MRI, may be a causal factor in the development of cortical folding.},

	abstract = {Brain iron is vital to multiple aspects of brain function, including oxidative metabolism, myelination, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Atypical iron concentration in the basal ganglia is associated with neurodegenerative disorders in aging and cognitive deficits. However, the normative development of brain iron concentration in adolescence and its relationship to cognition are less well understood. Here, we address this gap in a longitudinal sample of 922 humans aged 8–26 years at the first visit (M = 15.1, SD = 3.72; 336 males, 486 females) with up to four multiecho T2* scans each. Using this sample of 1236 imaging sessions, we assessed the longitudinal developmental trajectories of tissue iron in the basal ganglia. We quantified tissue iron concentration using R2* relaxometry within four basal ganglia regions, including the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and globus pallidus. The longitudinal development of R2* was modeled using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) with splines to capture linear and nonlinear developmental processes. We observed significant increases in R2* across all regions, with the greatest and most prolonged increases occurring in the globus pallidus and putamen. Further, we found that the developmental trajectory of R2* in the putamen is significantly related to individual differences in cognitive ability, such that greater cognitive ability is increasingly associated with greater iron concentration through late adolescence and young-adulthood. Together, our results suggest a prolonged period of basal ganglia iron enrichment that extends into the mid-twenties, with diminished iron concentration associated with poorer cognitive ability during late adolescence.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Brain tissue iron is essential to healthy brain function. Atypical basal ganglia tissue iron levels have been linked to impaired cognition in iron deficient children and adults with neurodegenerative disorders. However, the normative developmental trajectory of basal ganglia iron concentration during adolescence and its association with cognition are less well understood. In the largest study of tissue iron development yet reported, we characterize the developmental trajectory of tissue iron concentration across the basal ganglia during adolescence and provide evidence that diminished iron content is associated with poorer cognitive performance even in healthy youth. These results highlight the transition from adolescence to adulthood as a period of dynamic maturation of tissue iron concentration in the basal ganglia.},

While some new methods have been proposed to more accurately account for such data, these methods are based on iterative algorithms that are slow and failure-prone. In this article, we propose the use of the Sandwich Estimator method which first estimates the parameters of interest with a simple Ordinary Least Square model and second estimates variances/covariances with the “so-called” Sandwich Estimator (SwE) which accounts for the within-subject correlation existing in longitudinal data. Here, we introduce the SwE method in its classic form, and we review and propose several adjustments to improve its behaviour, specifically in small samples. We use intensive Monte Carlo simulations to compare all considered adjustments and isolate the best combination for neuroimaging data. We also compare the SwE method to other popular methods and demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we analyse a highly unbalanced longitudinal dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and demonstrate the flexibility of the SwE method to fit within- and between-subject effects in a single model. Software implementing this SwE method has been made freely available at http://warwick.ac.uk/tenichols/SwE.},

However, these studies are hindered by differences in images acquired across different scanners, so-called scanner effects, in the raw images and derived measurements. These effects have been shown to bias comparison between scanners, mask biologically meaningful associations, and even introduce spurious associations. To address this, the field has focused on harmonizing data via removing the scanner differences in mean and variance of measurements. Contemporaneously with the increase in popularity of multi-center imaging, the use of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), which refers to machine learning and multivariate statistical techniques for group comparisons or predictive modeling, has also become commonplace. These approaches have been shown to provide improved sensitivity, specificity, and power due to their modeling the joint relationship across measurements in the brain. In this work, we demonstrate that these currently available methods for removing site effects are inherently insufficient for MVPA. This stems from the fact that no currently available harmonization approach has addressed how correlations between measurements can vary across sites. Using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, we show that considerable differences in covariance exist across sites, and that the state-of-the-art harmonization techniques do not address this issue. We also propose a novel methodology that harmonizes covariance of multivariate image measurements across sites and demonstrate its improved performance in data harmonization, which further facilitates more power for detection of clinically relevant associations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Appropriate imputation inference requires both an unbiased imputation estimator and an unbiased variance estimator. The commonly used variance estimator, proposed by Rubin, can be biased when the imputation and analysis models are misspecified and/or incompatible. Robins and Wang proposed an alternative approach, which allows for such misspecification and incompatibility, but it is considerably more complex. It is unknown whether in practice Robins and Wang’s multiple imputation procedure is an improvement over Rubin’s multiple imputation. We conducted a critical review of these two multiple imputation approaches, a re-sampling method called full mechanism bootstrapping and our modified Rubin’s multiple imputation procedure via simulations and an application to data. We explored four common scenarios of misspecification and incompatibility. In general, for a moderate sample size (n = 1000), Robins and Wang’s multiple imputation produced the narrowest confidence intervals, with acceptable coverage. For a small sample size (n = 100) Rubin’s multiple imputation, overall, outperformed the other methods. Full mechanism bootstrapping was inefficient relative to the other methods and required modelling of the missing data mechanism under the missing at random assumption. Our proposed modification showed an improvement over Rubin’s multiple imputation in the presence of misspecification. Overall, Rubin’s multiple imputation variance estimator can fail in the presence of incompatibility and/or misspecification. For unavoidable incompatibility and/or misspecification, Robins and Wang’s multiple imputation could provide more robust inferences.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

	abstract = {Background
Memory is significantly impaired in schizophrenia. However, memory measures are often complex and confounded by additional impairments such as motivation and task comprehension, which can affect behavioral performance and obscure neural function during memory tasks. Neural signatures of memory encoding that are robust to potential confounds may shed additional light on neural deficits contributing to memory impairment in schizophrenia.
Methods
Here, we investigate a potential neural signature of memory—habituation—and its relationship with healthy and impaired memory function. To limit potential confounds, we used a passive depth of encoding memory task designed to elicit neural responses associated with memory encoding while limiting other cognitive demands. To determine whether habituation during encoding was predictive of intact memory processing, we first compared neural habituation over repeated encoding exposures with subsequent explicit memory in healthy individuals. We then tested whether a similar relationship existed in patients with schizophrenia.
Results
Explicit memory performance was impaired in patients with schizophrenia relative to healthy control subjects. In healthy participants, more habituation over repeated exposures during encoding was associated with greater repetition-related increases in accuracy during testing. However, in patients with schizophrenia, better performance was associated with less habituation, or a more sustained neural response during encoding.
Conclusions
These results suggest that sustained neural activity is required for normal repetition-related improvements in memory performance in schizophrenia, in line with a neural inefficiency model. Habituation may serve as a valuable index of neural processes that underlie behavioral memory performance.},

Further, the controllable probabilities of observing misleading and weak evidence provide assurance that the study design is reliable without affecting the strength of statistical evidence in the data. This paper illustrates the ideas and methods associated with using likelihood ratios to measure statistical evidence.

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a formidable challenge for psychiatry and neuroscience because of their high prevalence, lifelong nature, complexity and substantial heterogeneity. Facing these obstacles requires large-scale multidisciplinary efforts. Although the field of genetics has pioneered data sharing for these reasons, neuroimaging had not kept pace. In response, we introduce the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)—a grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing 1112 existing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573 age-matched typical controls (TCs; 7–64 years) (http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/). Here, we present this resource and demonstrate its suitability for advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on analyses of 360 male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We focused on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly disparate themes of both hypo- and hyperconnectivity in the ASD literature; both were detected, although hypoconnectivity dominated, particularly for corticocortical and interhemispheric functional connectivity. Exploratory analyses using an array of regional metrics of intrinsic brain function converged on common loci of dysfunction in ASDs (mid- and posterior insula and posterior cingulate cortex), and highlighted less commonly explored regions such as the thalamus. The survey of the ABIDE R-fMRI data sets provides unprecedented demonstrations of both replication and novel discovery. By pooling multiple international data sets, ABIDE is expected to accelerate the pace of discovery setting the stage for the next generation of ASD studies.},

	abstract = {In network approaches to psychopathology, disorders result from the causal interplay between symptoms (e.g., worry → insomnia → fatigue), possibly involving feedback loops (e.g., a person may engage in substance abuse to forget the problems that arose due to substance abuse). The present review examines methodologies suited to identify such symptom networks and discusses network analysis techniques that may be used to extract clinically and scientifically useful information from such networks (e.g., which symptom is most central in a person's network). The authors also show how network analysis techniques may be used to construct simulation models that mimic symptom dynamics. Network approaches naturally explain the limited success of traditional research strategies, which are typically based on the idea that symptoms are manifestations of some common underlying factor, while offering promising methodological alternatives. In addition, these techniques may offer possibilities to guide and evaluate therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

We analyze the p-curve for observational research in the presence of p-hacking. We show by means of simulations that even with minimal omitted-variable bias (e.g., unaccounted confounding) p-curves based on true effects and p-curves based on null-effects with p-hacking cannot be reliably distinguished. We also demonstrate this problem using as practical example the evaluation of the effect of malaria prevalence on economic growth between 1960 and 1996. These findings call recent studies into question that use the p-curve to infer that most published research findings are based on true effects in the medical literature and in a wide range of disciplines. p-values in observational research may need to be empirically calibrated to be interpretable with respect to the commonly used significance threshold of 0.05. Violations of randomization in experimental studies may also result in situations where the use of p-curves is similarly unreliable.},

	abstract = {Here we address the current issues of inefficiency and over-penalization in the massively univariate approach followed by the correction for multiple testing, and propose a more efficient model that pools and shares information among brain regions. Using Bayesian multilevel (BML) modeling, we control two types of error that are more relevant than the conventional false positive rate (FPR): incorrect sign (type S) and incorrect magnitude (type M). BML also aims to achieve two goals: 1) improving modeling efficiency by having one integrative model and thereby dissolving the multiple testing issue, and 2) turning the focus of conventional null hypothesis significant testing (NHST) on FPR into quality control by calibrating type S errors while maintaining a reasonable level of inference efficiency. The performance and validity of this approach are demonstrated through an application at the region of interest (ROI) level, with all the regions on an equal footing: unlike the current approaches under NHST, small regions are not disadvantaged simply because of their physical size. In addition, compared to the massively univariate approach, BML may simultaneously achieve increased spatial specificity and inference efficiency, and promote results reporting in totality and transparency. The benefits of BML are illustrated in performance and quality checking using an experimental dataset. The methodology also avoids the current practice of sharp and arbitrary thresholding in the p-value funnel to which the multidimensional data are reduced. The BML approach with its auxiliary tools is available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.},

	abstract = {Background: Since the early 2010s, the neuroimaging field has paid more attention to the issue of false positives. Several journals have issued guidelines regarding statistical thresholds. Three papers have reported the statistical analysis of the thresholds used in fMRI literature, but they were published at least three years ago and surveyed papers published during 2007–2012. This study revisited this topic to evaluate the changes in this field. Methods: The PubMed database was searched to identify the task-based (not resting-state) fMRI papers published in 2017 and record their sample sizes, inferential methods (e.g. voxelwise or clusterwise), theoretical methods (e.g. parametric or non-parametric), significance level, cluster-defining primary threshold (CDT), volume of analysis (whole brain or region of interest) and software used. Results: The majority (95.6\%) of the 388 analyzed articles reported statistics corrected for multiple comparisons. A large proportion (69.6\%) of the 388 articles reported main results by clusterwise inference. The analyzed articles mostly used software Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM), Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) or FMRIB Software Library (FSL) to conduct statistical analysis. There were 70.9\%, 37.6\% and 23.1\% of SPM, AFNI and FSL studies, respectively, that used a CDT of p ≤ 0.001. The statistical sample size across the articles ranged between 7 and 1299 with a median of 33. Sample size did not significantly correlate with the level of statistical threshold. Conclusions: There were still around 53\% (142/270) studies using clusterwise inference that chose a more liberal CDT than p = 0.001 (n = 121) or did not report their CDT (n = 21), down from around 61\% reported by Woo et al. (2014). For FSL studies, it seemed that the CDT practice had no improvement since the survey by Woo et al. (2014). A few studies chose unconventional CDT such as p = 0.0125 or 0.004. Such practice might create an impression that the threshold alterations were attempted to show “desired” clusters. The median sample size used in the analyzed articles was similar to those reported in previous surveys. In conclusion, there seemed to be no change in the statistical practice compared to the early 2010s.},

	abstract = {Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (R-fMRI) holds the promise to reveal functional biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, extracting such biomarkers is challenging for complex multi-faceted neuropathologies, such as autism spectrum disorders. Large multi-site datasets increase sample sizes to compensate for this complexity, at the cost of uncontrolled heterogeneity. This heterogeneity raises new challenges, akin to those face in realistic diagnostic applications. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of inter-site classification of neuropsychiatric status, with an application to the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database, a large (N=871) multi-site autism dataset. For this purpose, we investigate pipelines that extract the most predictive biomarkers from the data. These R-fMRI pipelines build participant-specific connectomes from functionally-defined brain areas. Connectomes are then compared across participants to learn patterns of connectivity that differentiate typical controls from individuals with autism. We predict this neuropsychiatric status for participants from the same acquisition sites or different, unseen, ones. Good choices of methods for the various steps of the pipeline lead to 67\% prediction accuracy on the full ABIDE data, which is significantly better than previously reported results. We perform extensive validation on multiple subsets of the data defined by different inclusion criteria. These enables detailed analysis of the factors contributing to successful connectome-based prediction. First, prediction accuracy improves as we include more subjects, up to the maximum amount of subjects available. Second, the definition of functional brain areas is of paramount importance for biomarker discovery: brain areas extracted from large R-fMRI datasets outperform reference atlases in the classification tasks.},

	abstract = {Developmental cognitive neuroscience is a rapidly growing field that examines the relationships between biological development and cognitive ability. In the past decade, there has been ongoing refinement of concepts and methodology related to the study of ‘functional connectivity’ among distributed brain regions believed to underlie cognition and behavioral control. Due to the recent availability of relatively easy-to-use tools for functional connectivity analysis, there has been a sharp upsurge of studies that seek to characterize normal and psychopathologically abnormal brain functional integration. However, relatively few studies have applied functional and effective connectivity analysis techniques to developmental cognitive neuroscience. Functional and effective connectivity analysis methods are ideally suited to advance our understanding of the neural substrates of cognitive development, particularly in understanding how and why changes in the functional ‘wiring’ of neural networks promotes optimal cognitive control throughout development. The purpose of this review is to summarize the central concepts, methods, and findings of functional integration neuroimaging research to discuss key questions in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience. These ideas will be presented within a context that merges relevant concepts and proposals from different developmental theorists. The review will outline a few general predictions about likely relationships between typical ‘executive’ cognitive maturation and changes in brain network functional integration during adolescence. Although not exhaustive, this conceptual review also will showcase some of recent findings that have emerged to support these predictions.},

These two approaches generally have tested different types of hypotheses using different analysis techniques. This has hampered the convergence of findings. Although much has been learned about system-wide changes to adolescents’ neural network organization, if both rs-fcMRI and t-fcMRI approaches draw upon each other's methodology and ask broader questions, it will produce a more detailed connectome-informed theory of adolescent neurodevelopment to guide physiological, clinical, and other lines of research.},

Cognitive neuroscience research in the last two decades has improved our understanding of adolescent brain development.

These changes are associated with a greater strengthening and separation of brain networks, both in terms of structure and function, as well as improved cognitive skills. Adolescent-specific sub-cortical reactivity to emotions and rewards, contrasted with their developing self-control skills, are thought to account for their greater sensitivity to the socio-affective context.

In the case of pure treatment models, where all observations within clusters are either treated or not, the latter procedure can work remarkably well. The key requirement is that all cluster sizes, regardless of treatment, should be similar. Unfortunately, the analogue of this requirement is not likely to hold for difference-in-differences regressions.

We state conditions under which asymptotic and bootstrap tests and confidence intervals are asymptotically valid. These conditions put limits on the rates at which the cluster sizes can increase as the number of clusters tends to infinity. We also derive Edgeworth expansions for the asymptotic and bootstrap test statistics. Simulation experiments illustrate the theoretical results and suggest that alternative variants of the wild cluster bootstrap may perform quite differently. The Edgeworth expansions explain the overrejection of asymptotic tests and shed light on the choice of auxiliary distribution and whether to use restricted or unrestricted estimates in the bootstrap data-generating process.},

	abstract = {Many large-scale longitudinal imaging studies have been or are being widely conducted to better understand the progress of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and normal brain development. The goal of this article is to develop a multiscale adaptive generalized estimation equation (MAGEE) method for spatial and adaptive analysis of neuroimaging data from longitudinal studies. MAGEE is applicable to making statistical inference on regression coefficients in both balanced and unbalanced longitudinal designs and even in twin and familial studies, whereas standard software platforms have several major limitations in handling these complex studies. Specifically, conventional voxel-based analyses in these software platforms involve Gaussian smoothing imaging data and then independently fitting a statistical model at each voxel. However, the conventional smoothing methods suffer from the lack of spatial adaptivity to the shape and spatial extent of region of interest and the arbitrary choice of smoothing extent, while independently fitting statistical models across voxels does not account for the spatial properties of imaging observations and noise distribution. To address such drawbacks, we adapt a powerful propagation–separation (PS) procedure to sequentially incorporate the neighboring information of each voxel and develop a new novel strategy to solely update a set of parameters of interest, while fixing other nuisance parameters at their initial estimators. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that MAGEE significantly outperforms voxel-based analysis.},

We therefore infer on topological features of the signal, such as the existence of local maxima or peaks above some threshold. Using results from random field theory, we assign a p-value to each maximum in an SPM and identify an adaptive threshold that controls false discovery rate, using the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure (1995). This provides a natural complement to conventional family wise error (FWE) control on local maxima. We use simulations to contrast these procedures; both in terms of their relative number of discoveries and their spatial accuracy (via the distribution of the Euclidian distance between true and discovered activations). We also assessed two other procedures: cluster-wise and voxel-wise FDR procedures. Our results suggest that (a) FDR control of maxima or peaks is more sensitive than FWE control of peaks with minimal cost in terms of false-positives, (b) voxel-wise FDR is substantially less accurate than topological FWE or FDR control. Finally, we present an illustrative application using an fMRI study of visual attention.},

IHI was more prevalent (left hemisphere: 15\% of healthy control participants, 27\% of schizophrenia patients; right hemisphere: 4\% of healthy control participants, 10\% of schizophrenia patients) and more severe in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy control participants. Severe IHI cases were associated with a higher rate of automated segmentation failure. IHI contributed to smaller hippocampal volume and increased R {\textgreater} L volume asymmetry in schizophrenia. The increased prevalence and severity of IHI supports the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia.

Failure to remove these unwanted artifacts will complicate downstream analysis and diminish the value of multiplexed imaging for clinical applications. Here, to compensate for unwanted variations, we automatically identify negative control cells for each marker within the same tissue and use their expression levels to infer background signal level. The intensity profile is normalized by the inferred level of the negative control cells to remove between-sample variation. Using a tissue microarray data and a pair of longitudinal biopsy samples, we demonstrated that the proposed approach can remove unwanted variations effectively and shows robust performance.},

Simulation studies have shown that of the different cluster permutation methods, the cluster mass statistic is generally the best. However, to date, there is no parametric cluster mass inference available. In this paper, we propose a cluster mass inference method based on random field theory (RFT). We develop this method for Gaussian images, evaluate it on Gaussian and Gaussianized t-statistic images and investigate its statistical properties via simulation studies and real data. Simulation results show that the method is valid under the null hypothesis and demonstrate that it can be more powerful than the cluster extent inference method. Further, analyses with a single subject and a group fMRI dataset demonstrate better power than traditional cluster size inference, and good accuracy relative to a gold-standard permutation test.},

The authors describe novel methods for economically ascertaining probability distributions under the null hypothesis, with fewer assumptions, by permutation of the observed data. Nominal Type I error control by permutation testing is generally excellent; whereas theoretical distributions may be over conservative. Permutation has the additional advantage that it can be used to test any statistic of interest, such as the sum of suprathreshold voxel statistics in a cluster (or cluster mass), regardless of its theoretical tractability under the null hypothesis.

	abstract = {In a massively univariate analysis of brain image data, statistical inference is typically based on intensity or spatial extent of signals. Voxel intensity-based tests provide great sensitivity for high intensity signals, whereas cluster extent-based tests are sensitive to spatially extended signals. To benefit from the strength of both, the intensity and extent information needs to be combined. Various ways of combining voxel intensity and cluster extent are possible, and a few such combining methods have been proposed. Poline et al.'s [NeuroImage 16 (1997) 83] minimum P value approach is sensitive to signals whose either intensity or extent is significant. Bullmore et al.'s [IEEE Trans. Med. Imag. 18 (1999) 32] cluster mass method can detect signals whose intensity and extent are sufficiently large, even when they are not significant by intensity or extent alone. In this work, we study such combined inference methods using combining functions (Pesarin, F., 2001. Multivariate Permutation Tests. Wiley, New York) and permutation framework [Holmes et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 16 (1996) 7], which allow us to examine different ways of combining voxel intensity and cluster extent information without knowing their distribution. We also attempt to calibrate combined inference by using weighted combining functions, which adjust the test according to signals of interest. Furthermore, we propose meta-combining, a combining function of combining functions, which integrates strengths of multiple combining functions into a single statistic. We found that combined tests are able to detect signals that are not detected by voxel or cluster size test alone. We also found that the weighted combining functions can calibrate the combined test according to the signals of interest, emphasizing either intensity or extent as appropriate. Though not necessarily more sensitive than individual combining functions, the meta-combining function is sensitive to all types of signals and thus can be used as a single test summarizing all the combining functions.},

Various methods are in use to deal with this issue, but they differ in their signal detection power for small- and large-scale effects. In this paper, we comprehensively describe a new method that is based on control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method increases sensitivity by exploiting the spatially clustered nature of neuroimaging effects. This is achieved by using a sliding window technique, in which FDR-control is first applied at a regional level. Thus, a new statistical map that is related to the regionally achieved FDR is derived from the available voxelwise P-values. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, thresholding based on this map is demonstrated to have better discriminatory power than conventional thresholding based on P-values. Secondly, it is shown that the resulting maps can be thresholded at a level that results in control of the global FDR. By means of statistical arguments and numerical simulations under widely varying conditions, our method is validated, characterized, and compared to some other common voxel-based methods (uncorrected thresholding, Bonferroni correction, and conventional FDR-control). It is found that our method shows considerably higher sensitivity as compared to conventional FDR-control, while still controlling the achieved FDR at the same level or better. Finally, our method is applied to two diverse neuroimaging experiments to assess its practical merits, resulting in substantial improvements as compared to the other methods.},

	abstract = {The threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) approach integrates cluster information into voxel-wise statistical inference to enhance detectability of neuroimaging signal. Despite the significantly increased sensitivity, the application of TFCE is limited by several factors: (i) generalisation to data structures, like brain network connectivity data is not trivial, (ii) TFCE values are in an arbitrary unit, therefore, P-values can only be obtained by a computationally demanding permutation-test. Here, we introduce a probabilistic approach for TFCE (pTFCE), that gives a simple general framework for topology-based belief boosting. The core of pTFCE is a conditional probability, calculated based on Bayes' rule, from the probability of voxel intensity and the threshold-wise likelihood function of the measured cluster size. In this paper, we provide an estimation of these distributions based on Gaussian Random Field theory. The conditional probabilities are then aggregated across cluster-forming thresholds by a novel incremental aggregation method. pTFCE is validated on simulated and real fMRI data. The results suggest that pTFCE is more robust to various ground truth shapes and provides a stricter control over cluster "leaking" than TFCE and, in many realistic cases, further improves its sensitivity. Correction for multiple comparisons can be trivially performed on the enhanced P-values, without the need for permutation testing, thus pTFCE is well-suitable for the improvement of statistical inference in any neuroimaging workflow. Implementation of pTFCE is available at https://spisakt.github.io/pTFCE.},

	abstract = {The most prevalent approach to activation localization in neuroimaging is to identify brain regions as contiguous supra-threshold clusters, check their significance using random field theory, and correct for the multiple clusters being tested. Besides recent criticism on the validity of the random field assumption, a spatial specificity paradox remains: the larger the detected cluster, the less we know about the location of activation within that cluster. This is because cluster inference implies “there exists at least one voxel with an evoked response in the cluster”, and not that “all the voxels in the cluster have an evoked response”. Inference on voxels within selected clusters is considered bad practice, due to the voxel-wise false positive rate inflation associated with this circular inference. Here, we propose a remedy to the spatial specificity paradox. By applying recent results from the multiple testing statistical literature, we are able to quantify the proportion of truly active voxels within selected clusters, an approach we call All-Resolutions Inference (ARI). If this proportion is high, the paradox vanishes. If it is low, we can further “drill down” from the cluster level to sub-regions, and even to individual voxels, in order to pinpoint the origin of the activation. In fact, ARI allows inference on the proportion of activation in all voxel sets, no matter how large or small, however these have been selected, all from the same data. We use two fMRI datasets to demonstrate the non-triviality of the spatial specificity paradox, and its resolution using ARI.

	abstract = {Permutation tests are increasingly being used as a reliable method for inference in neuroimaging analysis. However, they are computationally intensive. For small, non-imaging datasets, recomputing a model thousands of times is seldom a problem, but for large, complex models this can be prohibitively slow, even with the availability of inexpensive computing power. Here we exploit properties of statistics used with the general linear model (GLM) and their distributions to obtain accelerations irrespective of generic software or hardware improvements. We compare the following approaches: (i) performing a small number of permutations; (ii) estimating the p-value as a parameter of a negative binomial distribution; (iii) fitting a generalised Pareto distribution to the tail of the permutation distribution; (iv) computing p-values based on the expected moments of the permutation distribution, approximated from a gamma distribution; (v) direct fitting of a gamma distribution to the empirical permutation distribution; and (vi) permuting a reduced number of voxels, with completion of the remainder using low rank matrix theory. Using synthetic data we assessed the different methods in terms of their error rates, power, agreement with a reference result, and the risk of taking a different decision regarding the rejection of the null hypotheses (known as the resampling risk). We also conducted a re-analysis of a voxel-based morphometry study as a real-data example. All methods yielded exact error rates. Likewise, power was similar across methods. Resampling risk was higher for methods (i), (iii) and (v). For comparable resampling risks, the method in which no permutations are done (iv) was the absolute fastest. All methods produced visually similar maps for the real data, with stronger effects being detected in the family-wise error rate corrected maps by (iii) and (v), and generally similar to the results seen in the reference set. Overall, for uncorrected p-values, method (iv) was found the best as long as symmetric errors can be assumed. In all other settings, including for familywise error corrected p-values, we recommend the tail approximation (iii). The methods considered are freely available in the tool PALM — Permutation Analysis of Linear Models.},

	abstract = {Microvessel density (MVD) has been reported to have prognostic relevance for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, this finding is controversial because of the difficulty of MVD evaluation in this complex vascularized tumor type. The present study evaluates the use of an automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) system for objective and reproducible determination of tumor vascularization in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The AQUA system was applied to tissue microarrays with 284 primary ccRCC tumors. To determine angiogenesis in ccRCC, we created an epithelial/stromal mask consisting of CD10, epithelial membrane antigen, and vimentin to distinguish epithelial tumor cells from CD34-positive endothelial cells. Using immunofluorescence and computer-aided quantification of CD34 expression, we measured the relative microvessel area (MVA) and compared the MVA to the manually counted MVD. The MVA determined by AQUA in a test set with 209 ccRCCs ranged from 0\% to 30.3\% (mean ± SD, 10.1\% ± 6.3\%). The manually determined MVD ranged from 6 to 987 vessels/mm2 (416.8 ± 252.8 vessels/mm2). MVA and MVD were significantly correlated (P {\textless} .001). A larger MVA was associated with histologic grade (P {\textless} .001), tumor stage (P =.008), presence of metastasis (P = .005), presence of sarcomatoid areas (P {\textless} .001), and tumor-specific survival (P {\textless} .001). Using MVA as defined in the test set, all associationswith clinical and pathologic parameters were confirmed in a second independent validation set. MVA determination by AQUA is an objective and reliable method to quantify tumor vascularization in ccRCC. A large MVA correlates with a high MVD and is associated with better patient prognosis.},

Divergence estimation is typically solved estimating the densities first. Our main result shows this intermediate step is unnecessary and that the divergence can be either estimated using the empirical cdf or k-nearest-neighbour density estimation, which does not converge to the true measure for finite k. The convergence proof is based on describing the statistics of our estimator using waiting-times distributions, as the exponential or Erlang. We illustrate the proposed estimators and show how they compare to existing methods based on density estimation, and we also outline how our divergence estimators can be used for solving the two-sample problem.},

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is one of the most widely used of such techniques. VBM performs voxel-wise statistical analysis of smoothed spatially normalised segmented Magnetic Resonance Images. There are several reasons why the analysis should include only voxels within a certain mask. We show that one of the most commonly used strategies for defining this mask runs a major risk of excluding from the analysis precisely those voxels where the subjects' brains were most vulnerable to atrophy. We investigate the issues related to mask construction, and recommend the use of alternative strategies which greatly decrease this danger of false negatives.},

	abstract = {study of mapping and interaction of co-localized proteins at a sub-cellular level is important for understanding complex biological phenomena. One of the recent techniques to map co-localized proteins is to use the standard immuno-fluorescence microscopy in a cyclic manner (Nat Biotechnol 24:1270–8, 2006; Proc Natl Acad Sci 110:11982–7, 2013). Unfortunately, these techniques suffer from variability in intensity and positioning of signals from protein markers within a run and across different runs. Therefore, it is necessary to standardize protocols for preprocessing of the multiplexed bioimaging (MBI) data from multiple runs to a comparable scale before any further analysis can be performed on the data. In this paper, we compare various normalization protocols and propose on the basis of the obtained results, a robust normalization technique that produces consistent results on the MBI data collected from different runs using the Toponome Imaging System (TIS). Normalization results produced by the proposed method on a sample TIS data set for colorectal cancer patients were ranked favorably by two pathologists and two biologists. We show that the proposed method produces higher between class Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and lower within class KL divergence on a distribution of cell phenotypes from colorectal cancer and histologically normal samples.},

	abstract = {Motivated by a representation for the least squares estimator, we propose a class of weighted jackknife variance estimators for the least squares estimator by deleting any fixed number of observations at a time. They are unbiased for homoscedastic errors and a special case, the delete-one jackknife, is almost unbiased for heteroscedastic errors. The method is extended to cover nonlinear parameters, regression \$M\$-estimators, nonlinear regression and generalized linear models. Interval estimators can be constructed from the jackknife histogram. Three bootstrap methods are considered. Two are shown to give biased variance estimators and one does not have the bias-robustness property enjoyed by the weighted delete-one jackknife. A general method for resampling residuals is proposed. It gives variance estimators that are bias-robust. Several bias-reducing estimators are proposed. Some simulation results are reported.},

	abstract = {The National Institute of Mental Health strategic plan for advancing psychiatric neuroscience calls for an acceleration of discovery and the delineation of developmental trajectories for risk and resilience across the lifespan. To attain these objectives, sufficiently powered datasets with broad and deep phenotypic characterization, state-of-the-art neuroimaging, and genetic samples must be generated and made openly available to the scientific community. The enhanced Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) is a response to this need. NKI-RS is an ongoing, institutionally-centered endeavor aimed at creating a large-scale (N\&gt;1000), deeply phenotyped, community-ascertained, lifespan sample (ages 6-85 years old) with advanced neuroimaging and genetics. These data will be publically shared, openly and prospectively (i.e., on a weekly basis). Herein, we describe the conceptual basis of the NKI-RS, including study design, sampling considerations, and steps to synchronize phenotypic and neuroimaging assessment. Additionally, we describe our process for sharing the data with the scientific community while protecting participant confidentiality, maintaining an adequate database, and certifying data integrity. The pilot phase of the NKI-RS, including challenges in recruiting, characterizing, imaging, and sharing data, is discussed while also explaining how this experience informed the final design of the enhanced NKI-RS. It is our hope that familiarity with the conceptual underpinnings of the enhanced NKI-RS will facilitate harmonization with future data collection efforts aimed at advancing psychiatric neuroscience and nosology.},

Increased understanding of the neurobiology of sex-based differences in variability across the lifespan can provide insight into both disease vulnerability and resilience. In n = 3069 participants, from 8 to 95 years of age, we found widespread greater variability in males compared with females in cortical surface area and global and subcortical volumes for discrete brain regions. In contrast, variance in cortical thickness was similar for males and females. These findings were supported by multivariate analysis accounting for structural covariance, and present and stable across the lifespan. Additionally, we examined variability among brain regions by sex. We found significant age-by-sex interactions across neuroimaging metrics, whereby in very early life males had reduced among-region variability compared with females, while in very late life this was reversed. Overall, our findings of greater regional variability, but less among-region variability in males in early life may aid our understanding of sex-based risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. In contrast, our findings in late life may provide a potential sex-based risk mechanism for dementia.},

T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired in 411 subjects aged 44–48 from a random community sample and optimized voxel-based morphometry was applied to detect regional GM difference between men and women, correcting for effects of age, years of education, handedness, and total intracranial volume (TIV). Men had larger brain volumes and higher white matter (WM) to TIV ratios compared with women. Women had higher GM to TIV ratios than men. After controlling for age, years of education, handedness, and TIV, there were no significant differences between men and women in the total GM volumes. Regional sex dimorphism was present, with men having more GM volume in midbrain, left inferior temporal gyrus, right occipital lingual gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, and both cerebellar hemispheres. Women showed more GM in dorsal anterior, posterior and ventral cingulate cortices, and right inferior parietal lobule. Our results suggest sex dimorphism in GM in middle aged healthy individuals, which is not likely to be explained by brain pathology. These differences may provide the structural brain basis for sex differences in certain cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}INTRODUCTION{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}New therapies have been designed to stimulate the host’s immune system to fight cancer. Despite these exciting, recent successes, a large proportion of patients still do not respond to anti–programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) or anti–programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) therapies, and thus, biomarkers for patient selection are highly desirable. The only U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved histopathology biomarker tests for anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 therapy is assessment of PD-L1 protein expression by means of immunohistochemistry. This approach is unidimensional and has limitations. Innovative characterization of the tumor microenvironment (TME) with a focus on multidimensional, spatially resolved interactions at the single-cell level will provide critical mechanistic insights into therapeutic responses and potentially identify improved biomarkers for patient selection. Using multispectral approaches to image the TME and substituting cells for stars and galaxies, we applied the methodology and infrastructure developed for astronomy to pathologic analysis of specimens from patients with melanoma.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}RATIONALE{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The next generation of pathologic analyses will require platforms that can characterize the coexpression of key molecules on specific cellular subsets in situ and spatial relationships between tumor cells and multiple immune elements. To that aim, we applied astronomical algorithms for high-quality imaging and the establishment of relational databases to multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) labeling of pathology specimens, facilitating spatial analyses and immunoarchitectural characterization of the host-tumor interface. In all, we curated and coordinately mapped six markers, both individually and in combination in tumor tissue from 98 patients with melanoma receiving anti–PD-1 therapy. This dataset comprised {\textasciitilde}127,400 image mosaics composed of more than 100 million single cells. The data outputs were linked to patient outcomes, informing in a clinically relevant way how cancer evades the immune system and potentiating biomarker assay development for precision immunotherapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}RESULTS{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The imaging protocols used in this study were used to address outstanding questions regarding the impact of high-power field sampling strategies on biomarker performance. This information was then used to develop an approach for operator-independent field selection. The image handling strategies also facilitated the robust assessment of the intensity of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in situ (negative, low, mid, and high levels) on different cell types. Thus, with only six markers (PD-1, PD-L1, CD8, FoxP3, CD163, and Sox10/S100), we were able to develop 41 combinations of expression patterns for these molecules and map relatively rare cells such as CD8$^{\textrm{+}}$FoxP3$^{\textrm{+}}$ cells to the tumor stromal boundary. Moreover, a high density of CD8$^{\textrm{+}}$FoxP3$^{\textrm{+}}$PD-1$^{\textrm{low/mid}}$ cells was closely associated with response to PD-1 blockade. Cell types associated with a lack of response to therapy were also identified—for example, CD163$^{\textrm{+}}$ macrophages that were PD-L1$^{\textrm{–}}$. This latter phenotype was also found to have a negative effect on long-term survival. When these and other key cell phenotype densities were combined, they were highly predictive of objective response and stratified long-term patient outcomes after anti–PD-1–based therapies in both a discovery cohort and an independent validation cohort.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}CONCLUSION{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Here, we present the AstroPath platform, an end-to-end pathology workflow with rigorous quality control for creating quantitative, spatially resolved mIF datasets. Although the current effort focused on a six-plex mIF assay, the principles described here provide a general framework for the development of any multiplex assay with single-cell image resolution. Such approaches will vastly improve the standardization and scalability of these technologies, enabling cross-site and cross-study comparisons. This will be essential for multiplex imaging technologies to realize their potential as biomarker discovery platforms and ultimately as standard diagnostic tests for clinical therapeutic decision-making.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These "scanner effects" can hinder detection of biological features of interest, produce inconsistent results, and lead to spurious associations. We propose mica (multisite image harmonization by cumulative distribution function alignment), a tool to harmonize images taken on different scanners by identifying and removing within-subject scanner effects. Our goals in the present study were to (1) establish a method that removes scanner effects by leveraging multiple scans collected on the same subject, and, building on this, (2) develop a technique to quantify scanner effects in large multisite studies so these can be reduced as a preprocessing step. We illustrate scanner effects in a brain MRI study in which the same subject was measured twice on seven scanners, and assess our method's performance in a second study in which ten subjects were scanned on two machines. We found that unharmonized images were highly variable across site and scanner type, and our method effectively removed this variability by aligning intensity distributions. We further studied the ability to predict image harmonization results for a scan taken on an existing subject at a new site using cross-validation.},

	abstract = {Cancer development is a complex process driven by inherited and acquired molecular and cellular alterations. Prevention is the holy grail of cancer elimination, but making this a reality will take a fundamental rethinking and deep understanding of premalignant biology. In this Perspective, we propose a national concerted effort to create a Precancer Atlas (PCA), integrating multi-omics and immunity - basic tenets of the neoplastic process. The biology of neoplasia caused by germline mutations has led to paradigm-changing precision prevention efforts, including: tumor testing for mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency in Lynch syndrome establishing a new paradigm, combinatorial chemoprevention efficacy in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), signal of benefit from imaging-based early detection research in high-germline risk for pancreatic neoplasia, elucidating early ontogeny in BRCA1-mutation carriers leading to an international breast cancer prevention trial, and insights into the intricate germline-somatic-immunity interaction landscape. Emerging genetic and pharmacologic (metformin) disruption of mitochondrial (mt) respiration increased autophagy to prevent cancer in a Li-Fraumeni mouse model (biology reproduced in clinical pilot) and revealed profound influences of subtle changes in mt DNA background variation on obesity, aging, and cancer risk. The elaborate communication between the immune system and neoplasia includes an increasingly complex cellular microenvironment and dynamic interactions between host genetics, environmental factors, and microbes in shaping the immune response. Cancer vaccines are in early murine and clinical precancer studies, building on the recent successes of immunotherapy and HPV vaccine immune prevention. Molecular monitoring in Barrett's esophagus to avoid overdiagnosis/treatment highlights an important PCA theme. Next generation sequencing (NGS) discovered age-related clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Ultra-deep NGS reports over the past year have redefined the premalignant landscape remarkably identifying tiny clones in the blood of up to 95\% of women in their 50s, suggesting that potentially premalignant clones are ubiquitous. Similar data from eyelid skin and peritoneal and uterine lavage fluid provide unprecedented opportunities to dissect the earliest phases of stem/progenitor clonal (and microenvironment) evolution/diversity with new single-cell and liquid biopsy technologies. Cancer mutational signatures reflect exogenous or endogenous processes imprinted over time in precursors. Accelerating the prevention of cancer will require a large-scale, longitudinal effort, leveraging diverse disciplines (from genetics, biochemistry, and immunology to mathematics, computational biology, and engineering), initiatives, technologies, and models in developing an integrated multi-omics and immunity PCA - an immense national resource to interrogate, target, and intercept events that drive oncogenesis.

However, due to several factors such as noise, imaging artifacts, intrinsic tissue variation and partial volume effects, tissue classification remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a unifying framework for unsupervised segmentation of multimodal brain MR images including partial volume effect, bias field correction, and information given by a probabilistic atlas. Here-proposed method takes into account neighborhood information using a Hidden Markov Chain (HMC) model. Due to the limited resolution of imaging devices, voxels may be composed of a mixture of different tissue types, this partial volume effect is included to achieve an accurate segmentation of brain tissues. Instead of assigning each voxel to a single tissue class (i.e., hard classification), we compute the relative amount of each pure tissue class in each voxel (mixture estimation). Further, a bias field estimation step is added to the proposed algorithm to correct intensity inhomogeneities. Furthermore, atlas priors were incorporated using probabilistic brain atlas containing prior expectations about the spatial localization of different tissue classes. This atlas is considered as a complementary sensor and the proposed method is extended to multimodal brain MRI without any user-tunable parameter (unsupervised algorithm). To validate this new unifying framework, we present experimental results on both synthetic and real brain images, for which the ground truth is available. Comparison with other often used techniques demonstrates the accuracy and the robustness of this new Markovian segmentation scheme.},

Implicit in this scheme is the change in the tumor over time; however, most tumor segmentation algorithms do not use temporal information. Here we introduce an automated method using probabilistic reasoning over both space and time to segment brain tumors from 4D spatio-temporal MRI data. The 3D expectation-maximization method is extended using the hidden Markov model to infer tumor classification based on previous and subsequent segmentation results. Spatial coherence via a Markov Random Field was included in the 3D spatial model. Simulated images as well as patient images from three independent sources were used to validate this method. The sensitivity and specificity of tumor segmentation using this spatio-temporal model is improved over commonly used spatial or temporal models alone.},

For properly powered studies replication rate should be around 80\%, whereas in practice less than 40\% of the studies selected from different areas of psychology can be replicated. Researchers in cognitive psychology are hindered in estimating the power of their studies, because the designs they use present a sample of stimulus materials to a sample of participants, a situation not covered by most power formulas. To remedy the situation, we review the literature related to the topic and introduce recent software packages, which we apply to the data of two masked priming studies with high power. We checked how we could estimate the power of each study and how much they could be reduced to remain powerful enough. On the basis of this analysis, we recommend that a properly powered reaction time experiment with repeated measures has at least 1,600 word observations per condition (e.g., 40 participants, 40 stimuli). This is considerably more than current practice. We also show that researchers must include the number of observations in meta-analyses because the effect sizes currently reported depend on the number of stimuli presented to the participants. Our analyses can easily be applied to new datasets gathered.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is one of the few measurement technology s of biochemistry which, given a thin sample, is able to reveal its spatial chemical composition in the full molecular range. IMS produces a hyperspectral image, where for each pixel a high-dimensional mass spectrum is measured. Currently, the technology is mature enough and one of the major problems preventing its spreading is the under-development of computational methods for mining huge IMS datasets. This article proposes a novel approach for spatial segmentation of an IMS dataset, which is constructed considering the important issue of pixel-to-pixel variability., Methods: We segment pixels by clustering their mass spectra. Importantly, we incorporate spatial relations between pixels into clustering, so that pixels are clustered together with their neighbors. We propose two methods. One is non-adaptive, where pixel neighborhoods are selected in the same manner for all pixels. The second one respects the structure observable in the data. For a pixel, its neighborhood is defined taking into account similarity of its spectrum to the spectra of adjacent pixels. Both methods have the linear complexity and require linear memory space (in the number of spectra)., Results: The proposed segmentation methods are evaluated on two IMS datasets: a rat brain section and a section of a neuroendocrine tumor. They discover anatomical structure, discriminate the tumor region and highlight functionally similar regions. Moreover, our methods provide segmentation maps of similar or better quality if compared to the other state-of-the-art methods, but outperform them in runtime and/or required memory., Contact: theodore@math.uni-bremen.de},

There is increasing recognition of mixtures of asymmetric distributions as powerful alternatives to traditional mixtures of Gaussian and mixtures of t distributions. The present work contributes to that assertion by addressing some facets of estimation and inference for mixtures-of-gamma distributions, including in the context of model-based clustering. Maximum likelihood estimation of mixtures of gammas is performed using an expectation–conditional–maximization (ECM) algorithm. The Wilson–Hilferty normal approximation is employed as part of an effective starting value strategy for the ECM algorithm, as well as provides insight into an effective model-based clustering strategy. Inference regarding the appropriateness of a common-shape mixture-of-gammas distribution is motivated by theory from research on infant habituation. We provide extensive simulation results that demonstrate the strong performance of our routines as well as analyze two real data examples: an infant habituation dataset and a whole genome duplication dataset.},

	abstract = {The identification of sub-populations of patients with similar characteristics, called patient subtyping, is important for realizing the goals of precision medicine. Accurate subtyping is crucial for tailoring therapeutic strategies that can potentially lead to reduced mortality and morbidity. Model-based clustering, such as Gaussian mixture models, provides a principled and interpretable methodology that is widely used to identify subtypes. However, they impose identical marginal distributions on each variable; such assumptions restrict their modeling flexibility and deteriorates clustering performance.In this paper, we use the statistical framework of copulas to decouple the modeling of marginals from the dependencies between them. Current copula-based methods cannot scale to high dimensions due to challenges in parameter inference. We develop HD-GMCM, that addresses these challenges and, to our knowledge, is the first copula-based clustering method that can fit high-dimensional data. Our experiments on real high-dimensional gene-expression and clinical datasets show that HD-GMCM outperforms state-of-the-art model-based clustering methods, by virtue of modeling non-Gaussian data and being robust to outliers through the use of Gaussian mixture copulas. We present a case study on lung cancer data from TCGA. Clusters obtained from HD-GMCM can be interpreted based on the dependencies they model, that offers a new way of characterizing subtypes. Empirically, such modeling not only uncovers latent structure that leads to better clustering but also meaningful clinical subtypes in terms of survival rates of patients.An implementation of HD-GMCM in R is available at: https://bitbucket.org/cdal/hdgmcm/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Gene clustering analysis is found useful for discovering groups of correlated genes potentially co-regulated or associated to the disease or conditions under investigation. Many clustering methods including hierarchical clustering, K-means, PAM, SOM, mixture model-based clustering and tight clustering have been widely used in the literature. Yet no comprehensive comparative study has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods.Results: In this paper, six gene clustering methods are evaluated by simulated data from a hierarchical log-normal model with various degrees of perturbation as well as four real datasets. A weighted Rand index is proposed for measuring similarity of two clustering results with possible scattered genes (i.e. a set of noise genes not being clustered). Performance of the methods in the real data is assessed by a predictive accuracy analysis through verified gene annotations. Our results show that tight clustering and model-based clustering consistently outperform other clustering methods both in simulated and real data while hierarchical clustering and SOM perform among the worst. Our analysis provides deep insight to the complicated gene clustering problem of expression profile and serves as a practical guideline for routine microarray cluster analysis.Contact: ctseng@pitt.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging stack of technologies, which adds spatial dimension to conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing. New protocols, based on in situ sequencing or multiplexed RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization register positions of single molecules in fixed tissue slices. Analysis of such data at the level of individual cells, however, requires accurate identification of cell boundaries. While many existing methods are able to approximate cell center positions using nuclei stains, current protocols do not report robust signal on the cell membranes, making accurate cell segmentation a key barrier for downstream analysis and interpretation of the data. To address this challenge, we developed a tool for Bayesian Segmentation of Spatial Transcriptomics Data (Baysor), which optimizes segmentation considering the likelihood of transcriptional composition, size and shape of the cell. The Bayesian approach can take into account nuclear or cytoplasm staining, however can also perform segmentation based on the detected transcripts alone. We show that Baysor segmentation can in some cases nearly double the number of the identified cells, while reducing contamination. Importantly, we demonstrate that Baysor performs well on data acquired using five different spatially-resolved protocols, making it a useful general tool for analysis of high-resolution spatial data.},

Specifically, ClusterMap precisely clusters RNAs into subcellular structures, cell bodies, and tissue regions in both two- and three-dimensional space, and consistently performs on diverse tissue types, including mouse brain, placenta, gut, and human cardiac organoids.

Deciphering spatial phenotypic and molecular effects on the single-cell level is one of the grand challenges and a key to understanding the effects of cell–cell interactions and microenvironment. However, spatial information is usually overlooked by downstream data analyses, which usually consider single-cell read-out values as independent measurements for further averaging or clustering, thus disregarding spatial locations. With this work, we attempt to fill this gap. We developed a toolbox that allows one to test for the presence of a spatial effect in microscopy images of adherent cells and estimate the spatial scale of this effect. The proposed Python module can be used for any light microscopy images of cells as well as other types of single-cell data such as in situ transcriptomics or metabolomics. The input format of our package matches standard output formats from image analysis tools such as CellProfiler, Fiji, or Icy and thus makes our toolbox easy and straightforward to use, yet offering a powerful statistical approach for a wide range of applications. © 2019 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

	abstract = {Imaging mass spectrometry (imaging MS) has emerged in the past decade as a label-free, spatially resolved, and multipurpose bioanalytical technique for direct analysis of biological samples from animal tissue, plant tissue, biofilms, and polymer films.1,2 Imaging MS has been successfully incorporated into many biomedical pipelines where it is usually applied in the so-called untargeted mode-capturing spatial localization of a multitude of ions from a wide mass range.3 An imaging MS data set usually comprises thousands of spectra and tens to hundreds of thousands of mass-to-charge (m/z) images and can be as large as several gigabytes. Unsupervised analysis of an imaging MS data set aims at finding hidden structures in the data with no a priori information used and is often exploited as the first step of imaging MS data analysis. We propose a novel, easy-to-use and easy-to-implement approach to answer one of the key questions of unsupervised analysis of imaging MS data: what do all m/z images look like? The key idea of the approach is to cluster all m/z images according to their spatial similarity so that each cluster contains spatially similar m/z images. We propose a visualization of both spatial and spectral information obtained using clustering that provides an easy way to understand what all m/z images look like. We evaluated the proposed approach on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging MS data sets of a rat brain coronal section and human larynx carcinoma and discussed several scenarios of data analysis.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that mIF is becoming an important tool for immune profiling the tumor microenvironment, further advancing our understanding of the interplay between cancer and the immune system, and identifying predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy. Expediting mIF discoveries is leading to improved diagnostic panels, whereas it is important that mIF protocols be standardized to facilitate their transition into clinical use. Manual processing of sections for mIF is time consuming and a potential source of variability across numerous samples. To increase reproducibility and throughput we demonstrate the use of an automated slide stainer for mIF incorporating tyramide signal amplification (TSA). We describe two panels aimed at characterizing the tumor immune microenvironment. Panel 1 included CD3, CD20, CD117, FOXP3, Ki67, pancytokeratins (CK), and DAPI, and Panel 2 included CD3, CD8, CD68, PD-1, PD-L1, CK, and DAPI. Primary antibodies were first tested by standard immunohistochemistry and single-plex IF, then multiplex panels were developed and images were obtained using a Vectra 3.0 multispectral imaging system. Various methods for image analysis (identifying cell types, determining cell densities, characterizing cell-cell associations) are outlined. These mIF protocols will be invaluable tools for immune profiling the tumor microenvironment.},

However, these often require several subjective choices and cannot explicitly assign cells to an uncharacterized type. To help address these issues we present Astir, a probabilistic model to assign cells to cell types by integrating prior knowledge of marker proteins. Astir uses deep recognition neural networks for fast inference, allowing for annotations at the million-cell scale in the absence of a previously annotated reference. We apply Astir to over 2.4 million cells from suspension and imaging datasets and demonstrate its scalability, robustness to sample composition, and interpretable uncertainty estimates. We envision deployment of Astir either for a first broad cell type assignment or to accurately annotate cells that may serve as biomarkers in multiple disease contexts.

It is necessary to advance the method of spatial cross-correlation analysis to supplement the autocorrelation analysis. This paper presents a set of models and analytical procedures for spatial cross-correlation analysis. By analogy with Moran’s index newly expressed in a spatial quadratic form, a theoretical framework is derived for geographical cross-correlation modeling. First, two sets of spatial cross-correlation coefficients are defined, including a global spatial cross-correlation coefficient and local spatial cross-correlation coefficients. Second, a pair of scatterplots of spatial cross-correlation is proposed, and the plots can be used to visually reveal the causality behind spatial systems. Based on the global cross-correlation coefficient, Pearson’s correlation coefficient can be decomposed into two parts: direct correlation (partial correlation) and indirect correlation (spatial cross-correlation). As an example, the methodology is applied to the relationships between China’s urbanization and economic development to illustrate how to model spatial cross-correlation phenomena. This study is an introduction to developing the theory of spatial cross-correlation, and future geographical spatial analysis might benefit from these models and indexes.},

	abstract = {Despite years of discovery and attempts at validation, few molecular biomarkers achieve acceptance in the clinical setting. Tissue-based markers evaluated by immunohistochemistry suffer from a high degree of inter- and intraobserver variability. One recent advance in this field that promises to automate this process is the development of AQUA, a molecular-based method of quantitative assessment of protein expression. This system integrates a set of algorithms that allows for the rapid, automated, continuous, and quantitative analysis of tissue samples, including the separation of tumor from stromal elements and the subcellular localization of signals. This study uses the AQUA system to assess a recently described prostate cancer biomarker, α-methylacyl-CoA-racemase (AMACR), and to determine the effectiveness of the quantitative measurement of this marker as a means for making the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Using a prostate cancer progression tissue microarray containing a wide range of prostate tissues, AQUA was directly compared to standard immunohistochemical evaluation for AMACR protein expression using the p504s monoclonal antibody. Both methods produced similar results showing AMACR protein expression to be strongest in the clinically localized prostate cancer, followed by the metastatic tumor samples. Benign prostate tissue was categorized as negative for most tissue samples by immunohistochemistry. However, AMACR was detectable using the AQUA system at low levels using the standard 1:25 dilution but also at 1:250 dilution, which is not detectable by light microscopy. The AQUA system was also able to discriminate foamy gland prostate cancers, which are known to have a lower AMACR expression than typical acinar prostate cancers, from benign prostate tissue samples. Finally, a receiver-operating-characteristic curve was plotted to determine the specificity of the AMACR AQUA Z-score (normalized AQUA score) to predict that a given tissue microarray sample contains cancer. The area under the curve was calculated at 0.90 (P {\textless} 0.00001; 95\% CI, 0.84 to 0.95). At an AMACR AQUA Z-score score of −0.3, 91\% of the 70 samples classified as prostate cancer were correctly categorized without the intervention of a pathologist reviewing the tissue microarray slide. In conclusion, the AQUA system provides a continuous measurement of AMACR on a wide range of prostate tissue samples. In the future, the AMACR AQUA Z-score may be useful in the automated screening and evaluation of prostate tissue biomarkers.},

This potential is limited by uncertainties in assessing the significance of these maps. In this report, we describe an approach that may partially resolve this issue. A distinction is made between using SPMs as images of change significance and using them to identify foci of significant change. In the first case, the SPM can be reported nonselectively as a single mathematical object with its omnibus significance. Alternatively, the SPM constitutes a large number of repeated measures over the brain. To reject the null hypothesis, that no change has occurred at a specific location, a threshold adjustment must be made that accounts for the large number of comparisons made. This adjustment is shown to depend on the SPM's smoothness. Smoothness can be determined empirically and be used to calculate a threshold required to identify significant foci. The approach models the SPM as a stationary stochastic process. The theory and applications are illustrated using uniform phantom images and data from a verbal fluency activation study of four normal subjects.},

	abstract = {Mixture models are useful in a wide array of applications to identify subpopulations in noisy overlapping distributions. For example, in multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF), cell image intensities represent expression levels and the cell populations are a noisy mixture of expressed and unexpressed cells. Among mixture models, the gamma mixture model has the strength of being flexible in fitting skewed strictly positive data that occur in many biological measurements. However, the current estimation method uses numerical optimization within the expectation maximization algorithm and is computationally expensive. This makes it infeasible to be applied across many large data sets, as is necessary in mIF data. Powered by a recently developed closed-form estimator for the gamma distribution, we propose a closed-form gamma mixture model that is not only more computationally efficient, but can also incorporate constraints from known biological information to the fitted distribution. We derive the closed-form estimators for the gamma mixture model and use simulations to demonstrate that our model produces comparable results with the current model with significantly less time, and is excellent in constrained model fitting.},

	abstract = {In panel data models and other regressions with unobserved effects, fixed effects estimation is often paired with cluster-robust variance estimation (CRVE) to account for heteroscedasticity and un-modeled dependence among the errors. Although asymptotically consistent, CRVE can be biased downward when the number of clusters is small, leading to hypothesis tests with rejection rates that are too high. More accurate tests can be constructed using bias-reduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE based on a working model, in conjunction with a Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined, and describe how to apply the method when the regression is estimated after absorbing the fixed effects. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. In simulations covering a wide range of scenarios, we find that the conventional cluster-robust Wald test can severely over-reject while the proposed small-sample test maintains Type I error close to nominal levels. The proposed methods are implemented in an R package called clubSandwich. This article has online supplementary materials.},

	abstract = {The thalamus is composed of multiple nuclei densely connected with the cortex in an organized manner, forming parallel thalamocortical networks critical to sensory, motor, and cognitive functioning. Thalamocortical circuit dysfunction has been implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia, which also often exhibit sex differences in prevalence, clinical characteristics, and neuropathology. However, very little is known about developmental and sex effects on thalamocortical networks in youth. The present study characterized the effects of age, sex and psychosis symptomatology in anatomically constrained thalamocortical networks in a large community sample of youth (n = 1100, aged 8–21) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Cortical functional connectivity of seven anatomically defined thalamic nuclear groups were examined: anterior, mediodorsal, ventral lateral, ventral posterolateral, pulvinar, medial and lateral geniculate nuclear groups. Age and sex effects were characterized using complementary thalamic region-of-interest (ROI) to cortical ROI and voxel-wise analyses. Effects of clinical symptomatology were analyzed by separating youth into three groups based on their clinical symptoms; typically developing youth (n = 298), psychosis spectrum youth (n = 320), and youth with other psychopathologies (n = 482). As an exploratory analysis, association with PRIME scores were used as a dimensional measure of psychopathology. Age effects were broadly characterized by decreasing connectivity with sensory/motor cortical areas, and increasing connectivity with heteromodal prefrontal and parietal cortical areas. This pattern was most pronounced for thalamic motor and sensory nuclei. Females showed greater connectivity between multiple thalamic nuclear groups and the visual cortex compared to males, while males showed greater connectivity with the inferior frontal and orbitofrontal cortices. Youth with psychosis spectrum symptoms showed a subtle decrease in thalamic connectivity with the premotor and prefrontal cortices. Across all youth, greater PRIME scores were associated with lower connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and mediodorsal thalamus. By characterizing typical development in anatomically constrained thalamocortical networks, this study provides an anchor for conceptualizing disruptions to the integrity of these networks observed in neurodevelopmental disorders.},

	abstract = {Background
Thalamocortical white matter connectivity is disrupted in psychosis and is hypothesized to play a role in its etiology and associated cognitive impairment. Attenuated cognitive symptoms often begin in adolescence, during a critical phase of white matter and cognitive development. However, little is known about the development of thalamocortical white matter connectivity and its association with cognition.
Methods
The present study characterized effects of age, sex, psychosis symptomatology, and cognition in thalamocortical networks in a large sample of youth (n = 1144, aged 8-22 years, 46\% male) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), which included 316 typically-developing youth, 330 psychosis-spectrum youth, and 498 youth with other psychopathology. Probabilistic tractography was used to quantify percent total connectivity between the thalamus and six cortical regions, and assess microstructural properties (i.e. fractional anisotropy-FA) of thalamocortical white matter tracts.
Results
Overall, percent total connectivity of the thalamus was weakly associated with age and was not associated with psychopathology or cognition. In contrast, FA of all thalamocortical tracts increased significantly with age, was generally higher in males than females, and was lowest in psychosis-spectrum youth. FA of tracts linking the thalamus to prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex was related to better cognitive function across subjects.
Conclusions
By characterizing the pattern of typical development and alterations in those at risk for psychotic disorders, this study provides a foundation for further conceptualization of thalamocortical white matter microstructure as a marker of neurodevelopment supporting cognition and an important risk marker for psychosis.},

High co-morbidity suggests dimensional circuit-level abnormalities that cross diagnoses. Here we seek to identify brain-based dimensions of psychopathology using sparse canonical correlation analysis in a sample of 663 youths. This analysis reveals correlated patterns of functional connectivity and psychiatric symptoms. We find that four dimensions of psychopathology – mood, psychosis, fear, and externalizing behavior – are associated (r = 0.68–0.71) with distinct patterns of connectivity. Loss of network segregation between the default mode network and executive networks emerges as a common feature across all dimensions. Connectivity linked to mood and psychosis becomes more prominent with development, and sex differences are present for connectivity related to mood and fear. Critically, findings largely replicate in an independent dataset (n = 336). These results delineate connectivity-guided dimensions of psychopathology that cross clinical diagnostic categories, which could serve as a foundation for developing network-based biomarkers in psychiatry.},

The current study investigates the prevalence of incidental neuroradiologic findings within this population and their relationships with psychiatric conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain MR imaging from 58 individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome was reviewed by board-certified radiologists by using standard clinical procedures. Intracranial incidental findings were classified into 8 categories and compared with a large typically developing cohort.
RESULTS: The rate of incidental findings was significantly higher (P {\textless} .0001) in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome compared with typically developing individuals, driven by a high prevalence of cavum septum pellucidum (19.0\%) and white matter abnormalities (10.3\%). Both of these findings were associated with psychosis in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: Cavum septum pellucidum and white matter hyperintensities are significantly more prevalent in patients with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and may represent biomarkers for psychosis.},

	abstract = {Background
There is increased risk of developing psychosis in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). Although this condition is associated with morphologic brain abnormalities, simultaneous examination of multiple high-resolution measures of cortical structure has not been performed.
Methods
Fifty-three patients with 22q11DS, 30 with psychotic symptoms, were compared with demographically matched nondeleted youths: 53 typically developing and 53 with psychotic symptoms. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging measures of cerebral volume, cortical thickness, surface area, and an index of local gyrification were obtained and compared between groups.
Results
Patients with 22q11DS demonstrated global increases in cortical thickness associated with reductions in surface area, reduced index of local gyrification, and lower cerebral volumes relative to typically developing controls. Findings were principally in the frontal lobe, superior parietal lobes, and in the paramedian cerebral cortex. Focally decreased thickness was seen in the superior temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex in 22q11DS relative to nondeleted groups. Patterns between nondeleted participants with psychotic symptoms and 22q11DS were similar but with important differences in several regions implicated in schizophrenia. Post hoc analysis suggested that like the 22q11DS group, cortical thickness in nondeleted individuals with psychotic symptoms differed from typically developing controls in the superior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, regions previously linked to schizophrenia.
Conclusions
Simultaneous examination of multiple measures of cerebral architecture demonstrates that differences in 22q11DS localize to regions of the frontal, superior parietal, superior temporal, and paramidline cerebral cortex. The overlapping patterns between nondeleted participants with psychotic symptoms and 22q11DS suggest partially shared neuroanatomic substrates.},

	abstract = {Background
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is applied in investigation of brain biomarkers for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the quality of DTI measurements, like other neuroimaging techniques, is susceptible to several confounding factors (e.g., motion, eddy currents), which have only recently come under scrutiny. These confounds are especially relevant in adolescent samples where data quality may be compromised in ways that confound interpretation of maturation parameters. The current study aims to leverage DTI data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC), a sample of 1601 youths with ages of 8–21 who underwent neuroimaging, to: 1) establish quality assurance (QA) metrics for the automatic identification of poor DTI image quality; 2) examine the performance of these QA measures in an external validation sample; 3) document the influence of data quality on developmental patterns of typical DTI metrics.
Methods
All diffusion-weighted images were acquired on the same scanner. Visual QA was performed on all subjects completing DTI; images were manually categorized as Poor, Good, or Excellent. Four image quality metrics were automatically computed and used to predict manual QA status: Mean voxel intensity outlier count (MEANVOX), Maximum voxel intensity outlier count (MAXVOX), mean relative motion (MOTION) and temporal signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR). Classification accuracy for each metric was calculated as the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). A threshold was generated for each measure that best differentiated visual QA status and applied in a validation sample. The effects of data quality on sensitivity to expected age effects in this developmental sample were then investigated using the traditional MRI diffusion metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Finally, our method of QA is compared with DTIPrep.
Results
TSNR (AUC=0.94) best differentiated Poor data from Good and Excellent data. MAXVOX (AUC=0.88) best differentiated Good from Excellent DTI data. At the optimal threshold, 88\% of Poor data and 91\% Good/Excellent data were correctly identified. Use of these thresholds on a validation dataset (n=374) indicated high accuracy. In the validation sample 83\% of Poor data and 94\% of Excellent data was identified using thresholds derived from the training sample. Both FA and MD were affected by the inclusion of poor data in an analysis of an age, sex and race matched comparison sample. In addition, we show that the inclusion of poor data results in significant attenuation of the correlation between diffusion metrics (FA and MD) and age during a critical neurodevelopmental period. We find higher correspondence between our QA method and DTIPrep for Poor data, but we find our method to be more robust for apparently high-quality images.
Conclusion
Automated QA of DTI can facilitate large-scale, high-throughput quality assurance by reliably identifying both scanner and subject induced imaging artifacts. The results present a practical example of the confounding effects of artifacts on DTI analysis in a large population-based sample, and suggest that estimates of data quality should not only be reported but also accounted for in data analysis, especially in studies of development.},

	abstract = {Objective:

Disruption of executive function is present in many neuropsychiatric disorders. However, determining the specificity of executive dysfunction across these disorders is challenging given high comorbidity of conditions. Here the authors investigate executive system deficits in association with dimensions of psychiatric symptoms in youth using a working memory paradigm. The authors hypothesize that common and dissociable patterns of dysfunction would be present.

Method:

The authors studied 1,129 youths who completed a fractal n-back task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3-T as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Factor scores of clinical psychopathology were calculated using an item-wise confirmatory bifactor model, describing overall psychopathology as well as four orthogonal dimensions of symptoms: anxious-misery (mood and anxiety), behavioral disturbance (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder), psychosis-spectrum symptoms, and fear (phobias). The effect of psychopathology dimensions on behavioral performance and executive system recruitment (2-back {\textgreater} 0-back) was examined using both multivariate (matrix regression) and mass-univariate (linear regression) analyses.

Results:

Overall psychopathology was associated with both abnormal multivariate patterns of activation and a failure to activate executive regions within the cingulo-opercular control network, including the frontal pole, cingulate cortex, and anterior insula. In addition, psychosis-spectrum symptoms were associated with hypoactivation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas behavioral symptoms were associated with hypoactivation of the frontoparietal cortex and cerebellum. In contrast, anxious-misery symptoms were associated with widespread hyperactivation of the executive network.

Conclusions:

These findings provide novel evidence that common and dissociable deficits within the brain’s executive system are present in association with dimensions of psychopathology in youth.},

However, it is unclear when aberrations emerge in the disease process and if such deficits are present in association with less severe psychosis spectrum (PS) symptoms in youth.To investigate the presence of structural brain abnormalities in youth with PS symptoms.The Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort is a prospectively accrued, community-based sample of 9498 youth who received a structured psychiatric evaluation. A subsample of 1601 individuals underwent neuroimaging, including structural magnetic resonance imaging, at an academic and children’s hospital health care network between November 1, 2009, and November 30, 2011.Measures of brain volume derived from T1-weighted structural neuroimaging at 3 T. Analyses were conducted at global, regional, and voxelwise levels. Regional volumes were estimated with an advanced multiatlas regional segmentation procedure, and voxelwise volumetric analyses were conducted as well. Nonlinear developmental patterns were examined using penalized splines within a general additive model. Psychosis spectrum (PS) symptom severity was summarized using factor analysis and evaluated dimensionally.Following exclusions due to comorbidity and image quality assurance, the final sample included 791 participants aged youth 8 to 22 years. Fifty percent (n = 393) were female. After structured interviews, 391 participants were identified as having PS features (PS group) and 400 participants were identified as typically developing comparison individuals without significant psychopathology (TD group). Compared with the TD group, the PS group had diminished whole-brain gray matter volume (P = 3.4 × 10−4) when not accounting for intracranial volume and relatively expanded white matter volume when accounting for intracranial volume (P = 2.2 × 10−3). Voxelwise analyses revealed significantly lower gray matter volume in the medial temporal lobe (maximum z score = 5.2 and cluster size of 1225 for the right and maximum z score = 4.5 and cluster size of 310 for the left) as well as in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex. Volumetric reduction in the medial temporal lobe was correlated with PS symptom severity.Structural brain abnormalities that have been commonly reported in adults with psychosis are present early in life in youth with PS symptoms and are not due to medication effects. Future longitudinal studies could use the presence of such abnormalities in conjunction with clinical presentation, cognitive profile, and genomics to predict risk and aid in stratification to guide early interventions.},

	abstract = {Depressive symptoms are common in multiple psychiatric disorders and are frequent sequelae of trauma. A dimensional conceptualization of depression suggests that symptoms should be associated with a continuum of deficits in specific neural circuits. However, most prior investigations of abnormalities in functional connectivity have typically focused on a single diagnostic category using hypothesis-driven seed-based analyses. Here, using a sample of 105 adult female participants from three diagnostic groups (healthy controls, n=17; major depression, n=38; and post-traumatic stress disorder, n=50), we examine the dimensional relationship between resting-state functional dysconnectivity and severity of depressive symptoms across diagnostic categories using a data-driven analysis (multivariate distance-based matrix regression). This connectome-wide analysis identified foci of dysconnectivity associated with depression severity in the bilateral amygdala. Follow-up seed analyses using subject-specific amygdala segmentations revealed that depression severity was associated with amygdalo-frontal hypo-connectivity in a network of regions including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and anterior insula. In contrast, anxiety was associated with elevated connectivity between the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Taken together, these results emphasize the centrality of the amygdala in the pathophysiology of depressive symptoms, and suggest that dissociable patterns of amygdalo-frontal dysconnectivity are a critical neurobiological feature across clinical diagnostic categories.},

	abstract = {Background
Adolescence is a critical period for emotional maturation and is a time when clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression increase, particularly in females. However, few studies relate developmental differences in symptoms of anxiety and depression to brain development. Cerebral blood flow is one brain phenotype that is known to have marked developmental sex differences.
Methods
We investigated whether developmental sex differences in cerebral blood flow mediated sex differences in anxiety and depression symptoms by capitalizing on a large sample of 875 youths who completed cross-sectional imaging as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Perfusion was quantified on a voxelwise basis using arterial spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging at 3T. Perfusion images were related to trait and state anxiety using general additive models with penalized splines, while controlling for gray matter density on a voxelwise basis. Clusters found to be related to anxiety were evaluated for interactions with age, sex, and puberty.
Results
Trait anxiety was associated with elevated perfusion in a network of regions including the amygdala, anterior insula, and fusiform cortex, even after accounting for prescan state anxiety. Notably, these relationships strengthened with age and the transition through puberty. Moreover, higher trait anxiety in postpubertal females was mediated by elevated perfusion of the left amygdala.
Conclusions
Taken together, these results demonstrate that differences in the evolution of cerebral perfusion during adolescence may be a critical element of the affective neurobiological characteristics underlying sex differences in anxiety and mood symptoms.},

	abstract = {In the fields of neuroimaging and genetics, a key goal is testing the association of a single outcome with a very high-dimensional imaging or genetic variable. Often, summary measures of the high-dimensional variable are created to sequentially test and localize the association with the outcome. In some cases, the associations between the outcome and summary measures are significant, but subsequent tests used to localize differences are underpowered and do not identify regions associated with the outcome. Here, we propose a generalization of Rao’s score test based on projecting the score statistic onto a linear subspace of a high-dimensional parameter space. The approach provides a way to localize signal in the high-dimensional space by projecting the scores to the subspace where the score test was performed. This allows for inference in the high-dimensional space to be performed on the same degrees of freedom as the score test, effectively reducing the number of comparisons. Simulation results demonstrate the test has competitive power relative to others commonly used. We illustrate the method by analyzing a subset of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. Results suggest cortical thinning of the frontal and temporal lobes may be a useful biological marker of Alzheimer’s disease risk. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {Spatial extent inference (SEI) is widely used across neuroimaging modalities to adjust for multiple comparisons when studying brain-phenotype associations that inform our understanding of disease. Recent studies have shown that Gaussian random field (GRF)-based tools can have inflated family-wise error rates (FWERs). This has led to substantial controversy as to which processing choices are necessary to control the FWER using GRF-based SEI. The failure of GRF-based methods is due to unrealistic assumptions about the spatial covariance function of the imaging data. A permutation procedure is the most robust SEI tool because it estimates the spatial covariance function from the imaging data. However, the permutation procedure can fail because its assumption of exchangeability is violated in many imaging modalities. Here, we propose the (semi-) parametric bootstrap joint (PBJ; sPBJ) testing procedures that are designed for SEI of multilevel imaging data. The sPBJ procedure uses a robust estimate of the spatial covariance function, which yields consistent estimates of standard errors, even if the covariance model is misspecified. We use the methods to study the association between performance and executive functioning in a working memory functional magnetic resonance imaging study. The sPBJ has similar or greater power to the PBJ and permutation procedures while maintaining the nominal type 1 error rate in reasonable sample sizes. We provide an R package to perform inference using the PBJ and sPBJ procedures.},

Therefore, we sought to determine the differences in EOGBS and LOGBS disease by race over the past decade in Tennessee.This study used active population-based and laboratory-based surveillance data for invasive GBS disease conducted through Active Bacterial Core surveillance in selected counties across Tennessee. We included infants younger than 90 days and who had invasive GBS disease between 2009 and 2018.A total of 356 GBS cases were included, with 60\% having LOGBS. EOGBS and LOGBS had decreasing temporal trends over the study period. Overall, there were no changes in temporal trend noted in the rates of EOGBS and LOGBS among White infants. However, Black infants had significantly decreasing EOGBS and LOGBS temporal trends (relative risk [95\% confidence interval], .87 [.79, .96] [P = .007] and .90 [.84–.97] [P = .003], respectively).Years after the successful implementation of the universal screening guidelines, our data revealed an overall decrease in LOGBS rates, primarily driven by changes among Black infants. More studies are needed to characterize the racial disparities in GBS rates, and factors driving them. Prevention measures such as vaccination are needed to have a further impact on disease rates.},

	abstract = {Many key findings in neuroimaging studies involve similarities between brain maps, but statistical methods used to measure these findings have varied. Current state-of-the-art methods involve comparing observed group-level brain maps (after averaging intensities at each image location across multiple subjects) against spatial null models of these group-level maps. However, these methods typically make strong and potentially unrealistic statistical assumptions, such as covariance stationarity. To address these issues, in this article we propose using subject-level data and a classical permutation testing framework to test and assess similarities between brain maps. Our method is comparable to traditional permutation tests in that it involves randomly permuting subjects to generate a null distribution of intermodal correspondence statistics, which we compare to an observed statistic to estimate a p-value. We apply and compare our method in simulated and real neuroimaging data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. We show that our method performs well for detecting relationships between modalities known to be strongly related (cortical thickness and sulcal depth), and it is conservative when an association would not be expected (cortical thickness and activation on the n-back working memory task). Notably, our method is the most flexible and reliable for localizing intermodal relationships within subregions of the brain and allows for generalizable statistical inference.},

Advanced age is a known risk factor for development of delirium. However, the association between age and catatonia has not been described. We aim to describe the occurrence of catatonia, delirium, and coma by age group in a critically ill, adult population.Design: Convenience cohort, nested within two clinical trials and two observational cohort studies.Setting: Intensive care units in an academic medical center in Nashville, TN.Patients: 378 critically ill adult patients on mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors.Measurements and Main Results: Patients were assessed for catatonia, delirium, and coma by independent and blinded personnel, the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale, the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale. Of 378 patients, 23\% met diagnostic criteria for catatonia, 66\% experienced delirium, and 52\% experienced coma during the period of observation. There was no relationship found between age and catatonia severity or age and presence of specific catatonia items. The prevalence of catatonia was strongly associated with age in the setting of critical illness (p {\textless} 0.05). Delirium and comas' association with age was limited to the setting of catatonia.Conclusion: Given the significant relationship between age and catatonia independent of coma and delirium status, these data demonstrate catatonia's association with advanced age in the setting of critical illness. Future studies can explore the causative factors for this association and further elucidate the risk factors for acute brain dysfunction across the age spectrum.},

The biomarkers associated with the latent factors linking the exposure to the outcome are considered “mediators.” We derive the likelihood for this model and develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to maximize an L1-penalized version of this likelihood to limit the number of factors and associated biomarkers. We show that the resulting estimates are consistent and that the estimates of the nonzero parameters have an asymptotically normal distribution. In simulations, procedures based on this new model can have significantly higher power for detecting the mediating biomarkers compared with the simpler approaches. We apply our method to a study that evaluates the relationship between body mass index, 481 metabolic measurements, and estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.},

	abstract = {With multiple possible mediators on the causal pathway from a treatment to an outcome, we consider the problem of decomposing the effects along multiple possible causal path(s) through each distinct mediator. Under a path-specific effects framework, such fine-grained decompositions necessitate stringent assumptions, such as correctly specifying the causal structure among the mediators, and no unobserved confounding among the mediators. In contrast, interventional direct and indirect effects for multiple mediators can be identified under much weaker conditions, while providing scientifically relevant causal interpretations. Nonetheless, current estimation approaches require (correctly) specifying a model for the joint mediator distribution, which can be difficult when there is a high-dimensional set of possibly continuous and noncontinuous mediators. In this article, we avoid the need to model this distribution, by developing a definition of interventional effects previously suggested for longitudinal mediation. We propose a novel estimation strategy that uses nonparametric estimates of the (counterfactual) mediator distributions. Noncontinuous outcomes can be accommodated using nonlinear outcome models. Estimation proceeds via Monte Carlo integration. The procedure is illustrated using publicly available genomic data to assess the causal effect of a microRNA expression on the 3-month mortality of brain cancer patients that is potentially mediated by expression values of multiple genes.},

RESULTS: We implement and compare data transformations and normalization algorithms in multiplexed imaging data. Our methods adapt the ComBat and functional data registration methods to remove slide effects in this domain, and we present an evaluation framework to compare the proposed approaches. We present clear slide-to-slide variation in the raw, unadjusted data, and show that many of the proposed normalization methods reduce this variation while preserving and improving the biological signal. Further, we find that dividing multiplexed imaging data by its slide mean, and the functional data registration methods, perform the best under our proposed evaluation framework.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antiviral treatment is recommended for all hospitalized children with suspected or confirmed influenza, regardless of their risk profile. Few data exist on adherence to these recommendations, so we sought to determine factors associated with influenza testing and antiviral treatment in children.
METHODS: Hospitalized children {\textless}18 years of age with acute respiratory illness (ARI) were enrolled through active surveillance at pediatric medical centers in seven cities between 11/1/2015 and 6/30/2016; clinical information was obtained from parent interview and chart review. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to identify factors associated with influenza testing and antiviral treatment.
RESULTS: Of the 2299 hospitalized children with ARI enrolled during one influenza season, 51\% (n = 1183) were tested clinically for influenza. Clinicians provided antiviral treatment for 61 of 117 (52\%) patients with a positive influenza test versus 66 of 1066 (6\%) with a negative or unknown test result. In multivariable analyses, factors associated with testing included neuromuscular disease (aOR = 5.35, 95\% CI [3.58-8.01]), immunocompromised status (aOR = 2.88, 95\% CI [1.66-5.01]), age (aOR = 0.93, 95\% CI [0.91-0.96]), private only versus public only insurance (aOR = 0.78, 95\% CI [0.63-0.98]), and chronic lung disease (aOR = 0.64, 95\% CI [0.51-0.81]). Factors associated with antiviral treatment included neuromuscular disease (aOR = 1.86, 95\% CI [1.04, 3.31]), immunocompromised state (aOR = 2.63, 95\% CI [1.38, 4.99]), duration of illness (aOR = 0.92, 95\% CI [0.84, 0.99]), and chronic lung disease (aOR = 0.60, 95\% CI [0.38, 0.95]).
CONCLUSION: Approximately half of children hospitalized with influenza during the 2015-2016 influenza season were treated with antivirals. Because antiviral treatment for influenza is associated with better health outcomes, further studies of subsequent seasons would help evaluate current use of antivirals among children and better understand barriers for treatment.},

Generally, mIF data is used to examine the abundance of immune cells in the TIME; however, this does not capture spatial patterns of immune cells throughout the TIME, a metric increasingly recognized as important for prognosis. To address this gap, we developed an R package spatialTIME that enables spatial analysis of mIF data, as well as the iTIME web application that provides a robust but simplified user interface for describing both abundance and spatial architecture of the TIME. The spatialTIME package calculates univariate and bivariate spatial statistics (e.g. Ripley’s K, Besag’s L, Macron’s M and G or nearest neighbor distance) and creates publication quality plots for spatial organization of the cells in each tissue sample. The iTIME web application allows users to statistically compare the abundance measures with patient clinical features along with visualization of the TIME for one tissue sample at a time.spatialTIME is implemented in R and can be downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/FridleyLab/spatialTIME) or CRAN. An extensive vignette for using spatialTIME can also be found at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatialTIME/index.html. iTIME is implemented within a R Shiny application and can be accessed online (http://itime.moffitt.org/), with code available on GitHub (https://github.com/FridleyLab/iTIME).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Quantitative immunofluorescence is often used for immunohistochemistry quantification of proteins that serve as cancer biomarkers. Advanced image analysis systems for pathology allow capturing expression levels in each individual cell or subcellular compartment. However, only the mean signal intensity within the cancer tissue region of interest is usually considered as biomarker completely ignoring the issue of tumor heterogeneity.We propose using immunohistochemistry image-derived information on the spatial distribution of cellular signal intensity (CSI) of protein expression within the cancer cell population to quantify both mean expression level and tumor heterogeneity of CSI levels. We view CSI levels as marks in a marked point process of cancer cells in the tissue and define spatial indices based on conditional mean and conditional variance of the marked point process. The proposed methodology provides objective metrics of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in protein expressions that allow discriminating between different patterns of heterogeneity. The prognostic utility of new spatial indices is investigated and compared to the standard mean signal intensity biomarkers using the protein expressions in tissue microarrays incorporating tumor tissues from 1000+ breast cancer patients. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {The threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) approach integrates cluster information into voxel-wise statistical inference to enhance detectability of neuroimaging signal. Despite the significantly increased sensitivity, the application of TFCE is limited by several factors: (i) generalisation to data structures, like brain network connectivity data is not trivial, (ii) TFCE values are in an arbitrary unit, therefore, P-values can only be obtained by a computationally demanding permutation-test. Here, we introduce a probabilistic approach for TFCE (pTFCE), that gives a simple general framework for topology-based belief boosting. The core of pTFCE is a conditional probability, calculated based on Bayes' rule, from the probability of voxel intensity and the threshold-wise likelihood function of the measured cluster size. In this paper, we provide an estimation of these distributions based on Gaussian Random Field theory. The conditional probabilities are then aggregated across cluster-forming thresholds by a novel incremental aggregation method. pTFCE is validated on simulated and real fMRI data. The results suggest that pTFCE is more robust to various ground truth shapes and provides a stricter control over cluster “leaking” than TFCE and, in many realistic cases, further improves its sensitivity. Correction for multiple comparisons can be trivially performed on the enhanced P-values, without the need for permutation testing, thus pTFCE is well-suitable for the improvement of statistical inference in any neuroimaging workflow. Implementation of pTFCE is available at https://spisakt.github.io/pTFCE.},

Recent technological advances in next-generation sequencing- and imaging-based approaches have established the power of spatial transcriptomics to measure expression levels of all or most genes systematically throughout tissue space, and have been adopted to generate biological insights in neuroscience, development and plant biology as well as to investigate a range of disease contexts, including cancer. Similar to datasets made possible by genomic sequencing and population health surveys, the large-scale atlases generated by this technology lend themselves to exploratory data analysis for hypothesis generation. Here we review spatial transcriptomic technologies and describe the repertoire of operations available for paths of analysis of the resulting data. Spatial transcriptomics can also be deployed for hypothesis testing using experimental designs that compare time points or conditions—including genetic or environmental perturbations. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data are naturally amenable to integration with other data modalities, providing an expandable framework for insight into tissue organization.},

In the early stage of the illness, hyperactivity is present in the anterior hippocampus and is thought to spread to other regions as the illness progresses. However, there is limited evidence for changes in basal hippocampal function following the onset of psychosis. Resting state functional MRI signal amplitude may be a proxy measure for increased metabolism and disrupted oscillatory activity, both consequences of an excitation/inhibition imbalance underlying hippocampal hyperactivity. Here, we used fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) to test the hypothesis of progressive hippocampal hyperactivity in a two-year longitudinal case-control study. We found higher fALFF in the anterior and posterior hippocampus of individuals in the early stage of non-affective psychosis at study entry. Contrary to our hypothesis of progressive hippocampal dysfunction, we found evidence for normalization of fALFF over time in psychosis. Our findings support a model in which hippocampal fALFF is a marker of psychosis vulnerability or acute illness state rather than an enduring feature of the illness.},

We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size. The most often reported analysis was analysis of variance, and almost half of these reports were not accompanied by effect sizes. Partial η2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance. For t tests, 2/3 of the articles did not report an associated effect size estimate; Cohen's d was the most often reported.

The purposes of this study were to (a) determine the frequencies with which different effect sizes were reported in published, peer-reviewed articles in health education, promotion, and behavior journals and (b) discuss implications for reporting effect size in social science research. Across a 4-year time period (2010-2013), 1,950 peer-reviewed published articles were examined from the following six health education and behavior journals: American Journal of Health Behavior, American Journal of Health Promotion, Health Education \& Behavior, Health Education Research, Journal of American College Health, and Journal of School Health Quantitative features from eligible manuscripts were documented using Qualtrics online survey software. Of the 1,245 articles in the final sample that reported quantitative data analyses, approximately 47.9\% (n = 597) of the articles reported an effect size. While 16 unique types of effect size were reported across all included journals, many of the effect sizes were reported with little frequency across most journals. Overall, odds ratio/adjusted odds ratio (n = 340, 50.1\%), Pearson r/r(2) (n = 162, 23.8\%), and eta squared/partial eta squared (n = 46, 7.2\%) accounted for the most frequently used effect size.

	abstract = {Schizophrenia is a multifaceted neuropsychiatric disorder. Its onset is the result of complex interactions between genetic, developmental and environmental factors. It almost certainly presents a heterogeneous group of aetiologies which may not be reflected in the symptomatic/clinical presentation of patients. Therefore, a better molecular understanding of the disease onset and progression is urgently needed. The high complexity of the disorder and the heterogeneity of patient populations account for the slow progress of biomarker discovery approaches. Multi-omics profiling approaches can be employed to investigate large numbers of patient and control samples in a single experiment. These large scale experiments are required to identify disease intrinsic molecular signatures as well as patient subgroups with potentially distinct biochemical pathways underpinning their symptoms. In this overview, we describe some of the most important challenges for biomarker discovery for psychiatric disorders and emphasize how these problems contribute to the requirement of large sample numbers. Results of MS-based protein profiling studies in schizophrenia research are reviewed and technical advantages and difficulties of the methodologies described. We outline recent technological advances that generated impressive results in other areas of research and point to their applicability for biomarker discovery in psychiatric disorders.},

Therefore, conceptual tools and their translation to computational tools in the package sandwich are discussed, enabling the computation of sandwich estimators in general parametric models.

	abstract = {Significance: Resting-state functional connectivity imaging in mice with optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging could provide a powerful translational tool for developing imaging biomarkers in preclinical disease models. However, statistical interpretation of correlation coefficients is hampered by autocorrelations in the data. Aim: We sought to better understand temporal and spatial autocorrelations in optical resting-state data. We then adapted statistical methods from functional magnetic resonance imaging to improve statistical inference. Approach: Resting-state data were obtained from mice using a custom-built OSI system. The autocorrelation time was calculated at each pixel, and z scores for correlation coefficients were calculated using Fisher transforms and variance derived from either Bartlett’s method or xDF. The significance of each correlation coefficient was determined through control of the false discovery rate (FDR). Results: Autocorrelation was generally even across the cortex and parcellation reduced variance. Correcting variance with Bartlett’s method resulted in a uniform reduction in z scores, with xDF preserving high z scores for highly correlated data. Control of the FDR resulted in reasonable thresholding of the correlation coefficient matrices. The use of Bartlett’s method compared with xDF results in more conservative thresholding and fewer false positives under null hypothesis conditions. Conclusions: We developed streamlined methods for control of autocorrelation in OIS functional connectivity data in mice, and Bartlett’s method is a reasonable compromise and simplification that allows for accurate autocorrelation correction. These results improve the rigor and reproducibility of functional neuroimaging in mice.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease in which the degree of cortical atrophy in specific structures of the brain serves as a useful imaging biomarker. Recent approaches using linear mixed effects (LME) models in longitudinal neuroimaging have been powerful and flexible in investigating the temporal trajectories of cortical thickness. However, massive-univariate analysis, a simplified approach that obtains a summary statistic (e.g., a p-value) for every vertex along the cortex, is insufficient to model cortical atrophy because it does not account for spatial similarities of the signals in neighboring locations. In this article, we develop a permutation-based inference procedure to detect spatial clusters of vertices showing statistically significant differences in the rates of cortical atrophy. The proposed method, called SpLoc, uses spatial information to combine the signals adaptively across neighboring vertices, yielding high statistical power while controlling family-wise error rate (FWER) accurately. When we reject the global null hypothesis, we use a cluster selection algorithm to detect the spatial clusters of significant vertices. We validate our method using simulation studies and apply it to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to show its superior performance over existing methods. An R package for implementing SpLoc is publicly available.},

Specifically, we establish conditions under which the distribution of the maximum is approximated by that of the maximum of a sum of the Gaussian random vectors with the same covariance matrices as the original vectors. This result applies when the dimension of random vectors (\$p\$) is large compared to the sample size (\$n\$); in fact, \$p\$ can be much larger than \$n\$, without restricting correlations of the coordinates of these vectors. We also show that the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the random vectors with unknown covariance matrices can be consistently estimated by the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the conditional Gaussian random vectors obtained by multiplying the original vectors with i.i.d. Gaussian multipliers. This is the Gaussian multiplier (or wild) bootstrap procedure. Here too, \$p\$ can be large or even much larger than \$n\$. These distributional approximations, either Gaussian or conditional Gaussian, yield a high-quality approximation to the distribution of the original maximum, often with approximation error decreasing polynomially in the sample size, and hence are of interest in many applications. We demonstrate how our Gaussian approximations and the multiplier bootstrap can be used for modern high-dimensional estimation, multiple hypothesis testing, and adaptive specification testing. All these results contain nonasymptotic bounds on approximation errors.},

	abstract = {Multiplexed immunofluorescence bioimaging of single-cells and their spatial organization in tissue holds great promise to the development of future precision diagnostics and therapeutics. Current multiplexing pipelines typically involve multiple rounds of immunofluorescence staining across multiple tissue slides. This introduces experimental batch effects that can hide underlying biological signal. It is important to have robust algorithms that can correct for the batch effects while not introducing biases into the data. Performance of data normalization methods can vary among different assay pipelines. To evaluate differences, it is critical to have a ground truth dataset that is representative of the assay.A new immunoFLuorescence Image NOrmalization method is presented and evaluated against alternative methods and workflows. Multiround immunofluorescence staining of the same tissue with the nuclear dye DAPI was used to represent virtual slides and a ground truth. DAPI was restained on a given tissue slide producing multiple images of the same underlying structure but undergoing multiple representative tissue handling steps. This ground truth dataset was used to evaluate and compare multiple normalization methods including median, quantile, smooth quantile, median ratio normalization and trimmed mean of the M-values. These methods were applied in both an unbiased grid object and segmented cell object workflow to 24 multiplexed biomarkers. An upper quartile normalization of grid objects in log space was found to obtain almost equivalent performance to directly normalizing segmented cell objects by the middle quantile. The developed grid-based technique was then applied with on-slide controls for evaluation. Using five or fewer controls per slide can introduce biases into the data. Ten or more on-slide controls were able to robustly correct for batch effects.The data underlying this article along with the FLINO R-scripts used to perform the evaluation of image normalizations methods and workflows can be downloaded from https://github.com/GE-Bio/FLINO.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

FastPG also has higher cell assignment accuracy than two other fast clustering methods, FlowSOM and PARC.

	abstract = {Advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing technology have resulted in a wealth of studies aiming to identify transcriptomic cell types in various biological systems. There are multiple experimental approaches to isolate and profile single cells, which provide different levels of cellular and tissue coverage. In addition, multiple computational strategies have been proposed to identify putative cell types from single-cell data. From a data generation perspective, recent single-cell studies can be classified into two groups: those that distribute reads shallowly over large numbers of cells and those that distribute reads more deeply over a smaller cell population. Although there are advantages to both approaches in terms of cellular and tissue coverage, it is unclear whether different computational cell type identification methods are better suited to one or the other experimental paradigm. This study reviews three cell type clustering algorithms, each representing one of three broad approaches, and finds that PCA-based algorithms appear most suited to low read depth data sets, whereas gene clustering-based and biclustering algorithms perform better on high read depth data sets. In addition, highly related cell classes are better distinguished by higher-depth data, given the same total number of reads; however, simultaneous discovery of distinct and similar types is better served by lower-depth, higher cell number data. Overall, this study suggests that the depth of profiling should be determined by initial assumptions about the diversity of cells in the population, and that the selection of clustering algorithm(s) subsequently based on the depth of profiling will allow for better identification of putative transcriptomic cell types.},

	abstract = {Community detection is often used to understand the structure of large and complex networks. One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

RESULTS: We introduce a highly scalable graph-based clustering algorithm PARC-Phenotyping by Accelerated Refined Community-partitioning-for large-scale, high-dimensional single-cell data ({\textgreater}1 million cells). Using large single-cell flow and mass cytometry, RNA-seq and imaging-based biophysical data, we demonstrate that PARC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art clustering algorithms without subsampling of cells, including Phenograph, FlowSOM and Flock, in terms of both speed and ability to robustly detect rare cell populations. For example, PARC can cluster a single-cell dataset of 1.1 million cells within 13 min, compared with {\textgreater}2 h for the next fastest graph-clustering algorithm. Our work presents a scalable algorithm to cope with increasingly large-scale single-cell analysis.

Such images represent the cutting edge of digital histology and promise to revolutionize how diseases such as cancer are studied, diagnosed, and treated. Highly multiplexed tissue images are complex, comprising 109 or more pixels, 60-plus channels, and millions of individual cells. This makes manual analysis challenging and error-prone. Existing automated approaches are also inadequate, in large part, because they are unable to effectively exploit the deep knowledge of human tissue biology available to anatomic pathologists. To overcome these challenges, Facetto enables a semi-automated analysis of cell types and states. It integrates unsupervised and supervised learning into the image and feature exploration process and offers tools for analytical provenance. Experts can cluster the data to discover new types of cancer and immune cells and use clustering results to train a convolutional neural network that classifies new cells accordingly. Likewise, the output of classifiers can be clustered to discover aggregate patterns and phenotype subsets. We also introduce a new hierarchical approach to keep track of analysis steps and data subsets created by users; this assists in the identification of cell types. Users can build phenotype trees and interact with the resulting hierarchical structures of both high-dimensional feature and image spaces. We report on use-cases in which domain scientists explore various large-scale fluorescence imaging datasets. We demonstrate how Facetto assists users in steering the clustering and classification process, inspecting analysis results, and gaining new scientific insights into cancer biology.},

Recently, image-based profiling has shown promise as a means for broadly characterizing molecules’ effects on cells in several drug-discovery applications, including target-agnostic screening and predicting a compound’s mechanism of action (MOA). Several profiling methods have been proposed, but little is known about their comparative performance, impeding the wider adoption and further development of image-based profiling. We compared these methods by applying them to a widely applicable assay of cultured cells and measuring the ability of each method to predict the MOA of a compendium of drugs. A very simple method that is based on population means performed as well as methods designed to take advantage of the measurements of individual cells. This is surprising because many treatments induced a heterogeneous phenotypic response across the cell population in each sample. Another simple method, which performs factor analysis on the cellular measurements before averaging them, provided substantial improvement and was able to predict MOA correctly for 94\% of the treatments in our ground-truth set. To facilitate the ready application and future development of image-based phenotypic profiling methods, we provide our complete ground-truth and test data sets, as well as open-source implementations of the various methods in a common software framework.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-016-0895-y},
	abstract = {Background: Automated classification using machine learning often relies on features derived from segmenting individual objects, which can be difficult to automate. WND-CHARM is a previously developed classification algorithm in which features are computed on the whole image, thereby avoiding the need for segmentation. The algorithm obtained encouraging results but requires considerable computational expertise to execute. Furthermore, some benchmark sets have been shown to be subject to confounding artifacts that overestimate classification accuracy. Results: We developed CP-CHARM, a user-friendly image-based classification algorithm inspired by WND-CHARM in (i) its ability to capture a wide variety of morphological aspects of the image, and (ii) the absence of requirement for segmentation. In order to make such an image-based classification method easily accessible to the biological research community, CP-CHARM relies on the widely-used open-source image analysis software CellProfiler for feature extraction. To validate our method, we reproduced WND-CHARM's results and ensured that CP-CHARM obtained comparable performance. We then successfully applied our approach on cell-based assay data and on tissue images. We designed these new training and test sets to reduce the effect of batch-related artifacts. Conclusions: The proposed method preserves the strengths of WND-CHARM - it extracts a wide variety of morphological features directly on whole images thereby avoiding the need for cell segmentation, but additionally, it makes the methods easily accessible for researchers without computational expertise by implementing them as a CellProfiler pipeline. It has been demonstrated to perform well on a wide range of bioimage classification problems, including on new datasets that have been carefully selected and annotated to minimize batch effects. This provides for the first time a realistic and reliable assessment of the whole image classification strategy. © 2016 Uhlmann et al.},

As a result, higher-order patterns of tissue organization are poorly understood and not systematically connected to disease pathology or clinical outcomes. To address this gap, we developed UTAG, a novel method to identify and quantify microanatomical tissue structures in multiplexed images without human intervention. Our method combines information on cellular phenotypes with the physical proximity of cells to accurately identify organ-specific microanatomical domains in healthy and diseased tissue. We apply our method to various types of images across physiological and disease states to show that it can consistently detect higher level architectures in human organs, quantify structural differences between healthy and diseased tissue, and reveal tissue organization patterns with relevance to clinical outcomes in cancer patients.},

	abstract = {study of mapping and interaction of co-localized proteins at a sub-cellular level is important for understanding complex biological phenomena. One of the recent techniques to map co-localized proteins is to use the standard immuno-fluorescence microscopy in a cyclic manner (Nat Biotechnol 24:1270–8, 2006; Proc Natl Acad Sci 110:11982–7, 2013). Unfortunately, these techniques suffer from variability in intensity and positioning of signals from protein markers within a run and across different runs. Therefore, it is necessary to standardize protocols for preprocessing of the multiplexed bioimaging (MBI) data from multiple runs to a comparable scale before any further analysis can be performed on the data. In this paper, we compare various normalization protocols and propose on the basis of the obtained results, a robust normalization technique that produces consistent results on the MBI data collected from different runs using the Toponome Imaging System (TIS). Normalization results produced by the proposed method on a sample TIS data set for colorectal cancer patients were ranked favorably by two pathologists and two biologists. We show that the proposed method produces higher between class Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and lower within class KL divergence on a distribution of cell phenotypes from colorectal cancer and histologically normal samples.},

	abstract = {The benefit of integrating batches of genomic data to increase statistical power is often hindered by batch effects, or unwanted variation in data caused by differences in technical factors across batches. It is therefore critical to effectively address batch effects in genomic data to overcome these challenges. Many existing methods for batch effects adjustment assume the data follow a continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian distribution. However in RNA-seq studies the data are typically skewed, over-dispersed counts, so this assumption is not appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial regression models have been used previously to better capture the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction method, ComBat-seq, using a negative binomial regression model that retains the integer nature of count data in RNA-seq studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common differential expression software packages that require integer counts. We show in realistic simulations that the ComBat-seq adjusted data results in better statistical power and control of false positives in differential expression compared to data adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated in a real data example that ComBat-seq successfully removes batch effects and recovers the biological signal in the data.},

	abstract = {New technologies, such as multiplex immunofluorescence microscopy (mIF), are being developed and used for the assessment and visualization of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). These assays produce not only an estimate of the abundance of immune cells in the TIME, but also their spatial locations; however, there are currently few approaches to analyze the spatial context of the TIME. Thus, we have developed a framework for the spatial analysis of the TIME using Ripley’s K, coupled with a permutation-based framework to estimate and measure the departure from complete spatial randomness (CSR) as a measure of the interactions between immune cells. This approach was then applied to ovarian cancer using mIF collected on intra-tumoral regions of interest (ROIs) and tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 158 high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients in the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) (94 subjects on TMAs resulting in 259 tissue cores; 91 subjects with 254 ROIs). Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the association of abundance and spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, cytotoxic T-cells, and regulatory T-cells, and overall survival. We found that EOC patients with high abundance and low spatial clustering of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and cytotoxic T-cells in their tumors had the best overall survival. In contrast, patients with low levels of regulatory T-cells but with a high level of spatial clustering (compare to those with a low level of spatial clustering) had better survival. These findings underscore the prognostic importance of evaluating not only immune cell abundance but also the spatial contexture of the immune cells in the TIME. In conclusion, the application of this spatial analysis framework to the study of the TIME could lead to the identification of immune content and spatial architecture that could aid in the determination of patients that are likely to respond to immunotherapies.},

The power of multiplexing combined with spatial information and quantification was recently illustrated on breast cancer tissue and was described as next-generation IHC. Robust, accurate, and high-throughput cell segmentation is crucial for the analysis of this new generation of IHC data. To this end, we propose a watershed-based cell segmentation, which uses a nuclear marker and multiple membrane markers, the latter automatically selected based on their correlation. In comparison with the state-of-the-art segmentation pipelines, which are only using a single marker for object detection, we could show that the use of multiple markers can significantly increase the segmentation power, and thus, multiplexed information should be used and not ignored during the segmentation. Furthermore, we provide a novel, user-friendly open-source toolbox for the automatic segmentation of multiplexed histopathological images. © 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Digital viewing of histologic images is moving from presentations and publications to incorporation into the daily work of practicing pathologists. Many technologic limitations have been overcome recently, which should make widespread adoption more practical. The task now is for pathologists to become actively involved in its development and implementation, to ensure that the technology is developed with the intent to optimize workflow and to maintain diagnostic accuracy. An understanding of the basic precepts of digital imaging is required to make informed decisions related to hardware and software implementation and to collaborate with vendors and professionals outside of pathology (eg, regulatory agencies) as the technology rapidly develops.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the state of digital microscopy as it applies to the field of pathology and to define specific issues related to adoption of whole slide imaging systems.
DATA SOURCES: The information is derived from the experience of the author and review of the literature.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital microscopy is an important tool for surgical pathologists. It is currently an area of intense and rapid technologic development that will likely transform the workflow of many laboratories during the next several years.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is among the first tools with the capacity for multiplex analysis of more than 40 targets, which provides a novel approach to biomarker discovery. Here, we used IMC to characterize the tumor microenvironment of patients with metastatic melanoma who received immunotherapy in efforts to find indicative factors of treatment response. In spite of the new power of IMC, the image analysis aspects are still limited by the challenges of cell segmentation.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here, rather than segment, we performed image analysis using a newly designed version of the AQUA software to measure marker intensity in molecularly defined compartments: tumor cells, stroma, T cells, B cells, and macrophages. IMC data were compared with quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) and digital spatial profiling.
RESULTS: Validation of IMC results for immune markers was confirmed by regression with additional multiplexing methods and outcome assessment. Multivariable analyses by each compartment revealed significant associations of 12 markers for progression-free survival and seven markers for overall survival (OS). The most compelling indicative biomarker, beta2-microglobulin (B2M), was confirmed by correlation with OS by QIF in the discovery cohort and validated in an independent published cohort profiled by mRNA expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Using digital image analysis based on pixel colocalization to assess IMC data allowed us to quantitively measure 25 markers simultaneously on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue microarray samples. In addition to showing high concordance with other multiplexing technologies, we identified a series of potentially indicative biomarkers for immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma, including B2M.},

Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) and Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI) are two relatively recent technologies which enable clinical samples to be simultaneously analyzed for up to 40 parameters at subcellular resolution. Importantly, these "Mass Cytometry Imaging" (MCI) modalities are being rapidly adopted for studies of the immune system in both health and disease. In this review we discuss, first, the various applications of MCI to date. Second, due to the inherent challenge of analyzing high parameter spatial data, we discuss the various approaches that have been employed for the processing and analysis of data from MCI experiments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases feature stereotypical deposits of protein aggregates that selectively accumulate in vulnerable cells. The ability to simultaneously localize multiple targets in situ is critical to facilitate discovery and validation of pathogenic molecular pathways. Immunostaining methods enable in situ detection of specific targets. Effective stripping of antibodies, allowing successive rounds of staining while maintaining tissue adhesion and antigen integrity, is the main roadblock for enabling multiplex immunostaining in standard labs. Furthermore, stripping techniques require antibody-specific optimization, validation, and quality control steps.
NEW METHOD: Aiming to create protocols for multiplex localization of neurodegenerative-related processes, without the need for specialized equipment, we evaluated several antibody stripping techniques. We also recommend quality control steps to validate stripping efficacy and ameliorate concerns of cross-reactivity and false positives based on extensive testing.
RESULTS: A protocol using β-mercaptoethanol and SDS consistently enables reliable antibody stripping across multiple rounds of staining and minimizes the odds of cross-reactivity while preserving tissue adhesion and antigen integrity in human postmortem tissue.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Our proposed method is optimal for standard lab settings and shows consistent efficacy despite the intricacies of suboptimal human postmortem tissue and the need to strip markers bound to highly aggregated proteins. Additionally, it incorporates quality control steps to validate antibody stripping.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex immunofluorescence methods for studying neurodegenerative diseases in human postmortem tissue are feasible even in standard laboratories. Nevertheless, evaluation of stripping parameters during optimization and validation phases of experiments is prudent.},

	abstract = {Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease of the pancreas characterized by the loss of insulin-producing beta cells. Access to human pancreas samples for research purposes has been historically limited, restricting pathological analyses to animal models. However, intrinsic differences between animals and humans have made clinical translation very challenging. Recently, human pancreas samples have become available through several biobanks worldwide, and this has opened numerous opportunities for scientific discovery. In addition, the use of new imaging technologies has unraveled many mysteries of the human pancreas not merely in the presence of disease, but also in physiological conditions. Nowadays, multiplex immunofluorescence protocols as well as sophisticated image analysis tools can be employed. Here, we described the use of QuPath-an open-source platform for image analysis-for the investigation of human pancreas samples. We demonstrate that QuPath can be adequately used to analyze whole-slide images with the aim of identifying the islets of Langerhans and define their cellular composition as well as other basic morphological characteristics. In addition, we show that QuPath can identify immune cell populations in the exocrine tissue and islets of Langerhans, accurately localizing and quantifying immune infiltrates in the pancreas. Therefore, we present a tool and analysis pipeline that allows for the accurate characterization of the human pancreas, enabling the study of the anatomical and physiological changes underlying pancreatic diseases such as type 1 diabetes. The standardization and implementation of these analysis tools is of critical importance to understand disease pathogenesis, and may be informative for the design of new therapies aimed at preserving beta cell function and halting the inflammation caused by the immune attack.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Significant progress has been made since the first report of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in 1859, after decades of research that have contributed to the understanding of the genetic and environmental factors involved in IBD pathogenesis. Today, a range of treatments is available for directed therapy, mostly targeting the overactive immune response. However, the mechanisms by which the immune system contributes to disease pathogenesis and progression are not fully understood. One challenge hindering IBD research is the heterogeneous nature of the disease and the lack of understanding of how immune cells interact with one another in the gut mucosa. Introduction of a technology that enables expansive characterization of the inflammatory environment of human IBD tissues may address this gap in knowledge.
METHODS: We used the imaging mass cytometry platform to perform highly multiplex image analysis of IBD and healthy deidentified intestine sections (6 Crohn's disease compared to 6 control ileum; 6 ulcerative colitis compared to 6 control colon). The acquired images were graded for inflammation severity by analysis of adjacent H\&E tissue sections. We assigned more than 300,000 cells to unique cell types and performed analyses of tissue integrity, epithelial activity, and immune cell composition.
RESULTS: The intestinal epithelia of patients with IBD exhibited increased proliferation rates and expression of HLA-DR compared to control tissues, and both features were positively correlated with the severity of inflammation. The neighborhood analysis determined enrichment of regulatory T cell interactions with CD68+ macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and plasma cells in both forms of IBD, whereas activated lysozyme C+ macrophages were preferred regulatory T cell neighbors in Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our study shows the power of imaging mass cytometry and its ability to both quantify immune cell types and characterize their spatial interactions within the inflammatory environment by a single analysis platform.},

To test the potential for IMC to discriminate between different types of lesions, we selected a case with severe rebound MS disease activity after natalizumab cessation. With post-acquisition analysis pipelines we were able to: (1) Discriminate demyelinating macrophages from the resident microglial pool; (2) Determine which types of lymphocytes reside closest to blood vessels; (3) Identify multiple subsets of T and B cells, and (4) Ascertain dynamics of T cell phenotypes vis-à-vis lesion type and location.

These therapeutics have led to revolutionary breakthroughs; however, the efficacy of immunotherapy has been modest and is often restricted to a subset of patients. Hence, identification of which cancer patients will benefit from immunotherapy is essential. Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) microscopy allows for the assessment and visualization of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The data output following image and machine learning analyses for cell segmenting and phenotyping consists of the following information for each tumor sample: the number of positive cells for each marker and phenotype(s) of interest, number of total cells, percent of positive cells for each marker, and spatial locations for all measured cells. There are many challenges in the analysis of mIF data, including many tissue samples with zero positive cells or "zero-inflated" data, repeated measurements from multiple TMA cores or tissue slides per subject, and spatial analyses to determine the level of clustering and co-localization between the cell types in the TIME. In this review paper, we will discuss the challenges in the statistical analysis of mIF data and opportunities for further research.},

	abstract = {Objective: High-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) are heterogeneous, often diagnosed at an advanced stage, and associated with poor overall survival (OS, 39\% at five years). There are few data about the prognostic factors of late relapses in HGSOC patients who survived ≥five years, long-term survivors (LTS). The aim of our study is to assess the probability of survival according to the already survived time from diagnosis. Methods: Data from HGSOC patients treated between 1995 and 2016 were retrospectively collected to estimate the conditional probability of survival (CPS), probability of surviving Y years after diagnosis when the patient had already survived X years, and to determine the LTS prognostic factors. The primary endpoint was OS. Results: 404 patients were included; 120 of them were LTS. Patients were aged 61 years (range: 20-89), WHO performance status 0-1 in 86.9\% and 2 in 13.1\%, and Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique (FIGO) staging III and IV in 82.7\% and 17.3\% patients. Breast cancer (BRCA) status was available in 116 patients (33\% mutated), including 58 LTS (36\% mutated). No macroscopic residual disease was observed in 58.4\% patients. First-line platinum-based chemotherapy plus paclitaxel was administered in 80.4\% of patients (median: six cycles (range: 1-14)). After a 9 point 3-year follow-up, median OS was four years (95\% CI: 3.6-4.5). The CPS at five years after surviving one year was 42.8\% (95\% CI: 35.3-48.3); it increased to 81.7\% (95\% CI: 75.5-87.8) after four survived years. Progression-free interval{\textgreater}18 months was the only LTS prognostic factor in the multivariable analysis (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.23; 95\% CI: 0.13-0.40; p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusion: The CPS provided relevant and encouraging clinical information on the life expectancy of HGSOC patients who already survived a period of time after diagnosis. LTS prognostic factors are useful for clinicians and patients.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy harnesses the power of the adaptive immune system and has revolutionized the field of oncotherapy, as novel therapeutic strategies have been introduced into clinical use. The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has led to durable control of disease in a subset of advanced cancer patients, such as those with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. However, predicting patient responses to therapy remains a major challenge, due to the remarkable genomic, epigenetic, and microenvironmental heterogeneity present in each tumor. Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women, where hormone receptor-positive (HR+; estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor) BC comprises the majority ({\textgreater}50\%) and has better prognosis, while a minority ({\textless}20\%) are triple negative BC (TNBC), which has an aggressive phenotype. There is a clinical need to identify predictors of late recurrence in HR+ BC and predictors of immunotherapy outcomes in advanced TNBC. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have recently been shown to predict late recurrence in HR+, counter to the findings that TILs confer good prognosis in TNBC and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) subtypes. Furthermore, the spatial arrangement of TILs also appears to have prognostic value, with dense clusters of immune cells predicting poor prognosis in HR+ and good prognosis in TNBC. Whether TIL clusters in different breast cancer subtypes represent the same or different landscapes of TILs is unknown and may have treatment implications for a significant portion of breast cancer patients. Current histopathological staining technology is not sufficient for characterizing the ensembles of TILs and their spatial patterns, in addition to tumor and microenvironmental heterogeneity. However, recent advances in cyclic immunofluorescence enable differentiation of the subsets based on TILs, tumor heterogeneity, and microenvironment composition between good and poor responders. A computational framework for understanding the importance of the spatial relationships between TILs and tumor cells in cancer tissues, which will allow for quantitative interpretation of cyclic immunostaining, is also under development. This chapter will explore the workflow for a newly developed cyclic multiplexed-immunofluorescence (cmIF) assay, which has been optimized for formalin-fixed. paraffin-embedded tissues and developed to process digital images for quantitative single-cell based spatial analysis of tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment, including immune cell composition.},

METHODS: We used the automated quantitative analysis (AQUA) system and various concentrations of antibodies against HER2 (1 : 500 to 1 : 8000 dilutions), p53 (1 : 50 to 1 : 800 dilutions), and estrogen receptor (ER; 1 : 100 and 1 : 1000 dilutions) to assess expression of HER2 and p53 in a tissue microarray containing specimens from 250 breast cancer patients with long-term survival data available. HER2 expression in the tissue microarray was also assessed by conventional immunohistochemistry. Relative risk (RR) of disease-specific mortality was assessed for every cutpoint with the X-tile program. Cumulative disease-specific survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: For HER2 and p53 and an optimal cutpoint, when a high antibody concentration (i.e., 1 : 500 dilution) was used with the AQUA system, low expression was associated with poorer survival than high expression; however, when a low antibody concentration (i.e., 1 : 8000 dilution) was used, high expression was associated with poorer survival. For example, for a 1 : 8000 dilution of HER2 antibody and high expression defined as the top 15\% of HER2 expression, high HER2 expression was associated with increased disease-specific mortality (RR = 1.98, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21 to 3.23; P = .007), compared with low expression. However, for a 1 : 500 dilution of HER2 antibody and high expression defined as the top 85\% of HER2 expression, high HER2 expression was associated with decreased disease-specific mortality (RR = 0.47, 95\% CI = 0.29 to 0.76; P = .002), compared with low HER2 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker antibody concentration appears to dramatically affect the apparent relationship between biomarker expression and outcome.},

	abstract = {The study of organs and tissues on a molecular level is necessary as we seek an understanding of health and disease. Over the last few years, powerful highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches that rely on the serial imaging of tissues with fluorescently labeled antibodies and the simultaneous analysis using metal-labeled antibodies have emerged. These techniques enable analysis of dozens of epitopes in thousands of cells in a single experiment providing a systems level view of normal and disease processes at the single-cell level with spatial resolution in tissues. In this Review, I discuss, first, the highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches and the generated data. Second, I describe challenges that must be overcome to implement these imaging methods from bench to bedside, including issues with tissue processing and analyses of the large amounts of data generated. Third, I discuss how these methods can be integrated with readouts of genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and live cell information, and fourth, the novel applications possible in tissue biology, drug development, and biomarker discovery. I anticipate that highly multiplexed epitope-based imaging approaches will broadly complement existing imaging methods and will become a cornerstone of tissue biology and biomedical research and of precision medical applications.},

We present a single-cell transcriptomic and imaging atlas of the two most common human colorectal polyps, conventional adenomas and serrated polyps, and their resulting CRC counterparts. Integrative analysis of 128 datasets from 62 participants reveals adenomas arise from WNT-driven expansion of stem cells, while serrated polyps derive from differentiated cells through gastric metaplasia. Metaplasia-associated damage is coupled to a cytotoxic immune microenvironment preceding hypermutation, driven partly by antigen-presentation differences associated with tumor cell-differentiation status. Microsatellite unstable CRCs contain distinct non-metaplastic regions where tumor cells acquire stem cell properties and cytotoxic immune cells are depleted. Our multi-omic atlas provides insights into malignant progression of colorectal polyps and their microenvironment, serving as a framework for precision surveillance and prevention of CRC.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Motivation High-throughput fluorescent microscopy is a popular class of techniques for studying tissues and cells through automated imaging and feature extraction of hundreds to thousands of samples. Like other high-throughput assays, these approaches can suffer from unwanted noise and technical artifacts that obscure the biological signal. In this work we consider how an experimental design incorporating multiple levels of replication enables removal of technical artifacts from such image-based platforms.
Results We develop a general approach to remove technical artifacts from high-throughput image data that leverages an experimental design with multiple levels of replication. To illustrate the methods we consider microenvironment microarrays (MEMAs), a high-throughput platform designed to study cellular responses to microenvironmental perturbations. In application on MEMAs, our approach removes unwanted spatial artifacts and thereby enhances the biological signal. This approach has broad applicability to diverse biological assays.

It is shown that sensitivity to nonnormality in the multivariate observations is determined by the extent of nonnormality of the regressors. The randomization distribution of the generalized Mahalanobis distance is deduced. The multivariate analysis of variance is found to be robust to nonnormality whereas the test for equality of covariance matrices are found to be sensitive to nonnormality.

	abstract = {A number of statistical procedures involve the comparison of a `regression' mean square with a `residual' mean square using the normal-theory F distribution for reference. The use of the procedure for the analysis of actual data implies that the distribution of the mean-square ratio is insensitive to moderate non-normality. Many investigators, in particular Pearson (1931), Geary (1947), Gayen (1950), have considered the sensitivity of this distribution to parent non-normality for important special cases and a very general investigation was carried out by David \& Johnson (1951 a, b). The principal object of this paper is to demonstrate the overriding influence which the numerical values of the regression variables have in deciding sensitivity to non-normality and to demonstrate the essential nature of this dependency. We first obtain a simple approximation to the distribution of the regression F statistic in the non-normal case. This shows that it is `the extent of non-normality' in the regression variables (the x's), which determines sensitivity to non-normality in the observations (the y's). Our results are illustrated for certain familiar special cases. In particular the well-known robustness of the analysis of variance test to compare means of equal-sized groups and the notorious lack of robustness of the test to compare two estimates of variance from independent samples are discussed in this context. We finally show that it is possible to choose the regression variables so that, to the order of approximation we employ, non-normality in the y's is without effect on the distribution of the test statistic. Our results demonstrate the effect which the choice of experimental design has in deciding robustness to non-normality.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed our understanding of the human brain through well-replicated mapping of abilities to specific structures (for example, lesion studies) and functions1–3 (for example, task functional MRI (fMRI)). Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping4 (the median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible brain–behavioural phenotype associations5,6. Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available—with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals—to quantify BWAS effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. BWAS associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes. As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and effect size inflation decreased. More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread BWAS replication failures. In contrast to non-BWAS approaches with larger effects (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals.},

	abstract = {The isolated use of the statistical hypothesis testing for two group comparison has limitations, and its combination with effect size or confidence interval analysis as complementary statistical tests is recommended. In the present work, we estimate the use of these complementary statistical tests (i.e. effect size or confidence interval) in recently published in research articles in clinical and biomedical areas. Methods: The ProQuest database was used to search published studies in academic journals between 2019 and 2020. The analysis was carried out using terms that represent five areas of clinical and biomedical research: “brain”, “liver”, “heart”, “dental”, and “covid-19”. A total of 119,558 published articles were retrieved. Results: The relative use of complementary statistical tests in clinical and biomedical publications was low. The highest frequency usage of complementary statistical tests was among articles that also used statistical hypothesis testing for two-sample comparison. Publications with the term “covid-19” showed the lowest usage rate of complementary statistical tests when all article were analyzed but presented the highest rate among articles that used hypothesis testing. Conclusion: The low use of effect size or confidence interval in two-sample comparison suggests that coordinate measures should be taken in order to increase the use of this analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Their use should be emphasized in statistical disciplines for college and graduate students, become a routine procedure in research laboratories, and recommended by reviewers and editors of scientific journals.},

	abstract = {Pioneering work in human neuroscience has relied on the ability to map brain function using task-based fMRI, but the empirical validity of these inferential methods is still being characterized. A recent landmark study by Eklund and colleagues showed that popular multiple comparison corrections based on cluster extent suffer from unexpectedly low specificity (i.e., high false positive rate). Yet that study’s focus on specificity, while important, is incomplete. The validity of a method depends also on its sensitivity (i.e., true positive rate or power), yet the sensitivity of cluster correction remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed the sensitivity of gold-standard nonparametric cluster correction by resampling real data from five tasks in the Human Connectome Project and comparing results with those from the full “ground truth” datasets (n ​= ​480–493). Critically, we found that sensitivity after correction is lower than may be practical for many fMRI applications. In particular, sensitivity to medium-sized effects ({\textbar}Cohen’s d{\textbar} ​= ​0.5) was less than 20\% across tasks on average, about three times smaller than without any correction. Furthermore, cluster extent correction exhibited a spatial bias in sensitivity that was independent of effect size. In comparison, correction based on the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) statistic approximately doubled sensitivity across tasks but increased spatial bias. These results suggest that we have, until now, only measured the tip of the iceberg in the activation-mapping literature due to our goal of limiting the familywise error rate through cluster extent-based inference. There is a need to revise our practices to improve sensitivity; we therefore conclude with a list of modern strategies to boost sensitivity while maintaining respectable specificity in future investigations.},

We analyze the p-curve for observational research in the presence of p-hacking. We show by means of simulations that even with minimal omitted-variable bias (e.g., unaccounted confounding) p-curves based on true effects and p-curves based on null-effects with p-hacking cannot be reliably distinguished. We also demonstrate this problem using as practical example the evaluation of the effect of malaria prevalence on economic growth between 1960 and 1996. These findings call recent studies into question that use the p-curve to infer that most published research findings are based on true effects in the medical literature and in a wide range of disciplines. p-values in observational research may need to be empirically calibrated to be interpretable with respect to the commonly used significance threshold of 0.05. Violations of randomization in experimental studies may also result in situations where the use of p-curves is similarly unreliable.},

Researchers armed only with sample sizes and test results of the published findings can correct for publication bias.

However, in this article, we show that in some situations, p-curve behaves erratically, whereas p-uniform may yield implausible estimates of negative effect size. Moreover, we show that (and explain why) p-curve and p-uniform result in overestimation of effect size under moderate-to-large heterogeneity and may yield unpredictable bias when researchers employ p-hacking. We offer hands-on recommendations on applying and interpreting results of meta-analyses in general and p-uniform and p-curve in particular. Both methods as well as traditional methods are applied to a meta-analysis on the effect of weight on judgments of importance. We offer guidance for applying p-uniform or p-curve using R and a user-friendly web application for applying p-uniform.},

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, neuroimaging has become a ubiquitous tool in basic research and clinical studies of the human brain. However, no reference standards currently exist to quantify individual differences in neuroimaging metrics over time, in contrast to growth charts for anthropometric traits such as height and weight1. Here we assemble an interactive open resource to benchmark brain morphology derived from any current or future sample of MRI data (http://www.brainchart.io/). With the goal of basing these reference charts on the largest and most inclusive dataset available, acknowledging limitations due to known biases of MRI studies relative to the diversity of the global population, we aggregated 123,984 MRI scans, across more than 100 primary studies, from 101,457 human participants between 115 days post-conception to 100 years of age. MRI metrics were quantified by centile scores, relative to non-linear trajectories2 of brain structural changes, and rates of change, over the lifespan. Brain charts identified previously unreported neurodevelopmental milestones3, showed high stability of individuals across longitudinal assessments, and demonstrated robustness to technical and methodological differences between primary studies. Centile scores showed increased heritability compared with non-centiled MRI phenotypes, and provided a standardized measure of atypical brain structure that revealed patterns of neuroanatomical variation across neurological and psychiatric disorders. In summary, brain charts are an essential step towards robust quantification of individual variation benchmarked to normative trajectories in multiple, commonly used neuroimaging phenotypes.},

	doi = {10.1037/met0000470},
	abstract = {Publication bias poses a challenge for accurately synthesizing research findings using meta-analysis. A number of statistical methods have been developed to combat this problem by adjusting the meta-analytic estimates. Previous studies tended to apply these methods without regard to optimal conditions for each method’s performance. The present study sought to estimate the typical effect size attenuation of these methods when they are applied to real meta-analytic data sets that match the conditions under which each method is known to remain relatively unbiased (such as sample size, level of heterogeneity, population effect size, and the level of publication bias). Four-hundred and 33 data sets from 90 articles published in psychology journals were reanalyzed using a selection of publication bias adjustment methods. The downward adjustment found in our sample was minimal, with greatest identified attenuation of b = –.032, 95\% highest posterior density interval (HPD) ranging from –.055 to –.009, for the precision effect test (PET). Some methods tended to adjust upward, and this was especially true for data sets with a sample size smaller than 10. We propose that researchers should seek to explore the full range of plausible estimates for the effects they are studying and note that these methods may not be able to combat bias in small samples (with less than 10 primary studies). We argue that although the effect size attenuation we found tended to be minimal, this should not be taken as an indication of low levels of publication bias in psychology. We discuss the findings with reference to new developments in Bayesian methods for publication bias adjustment, and the recent methodological reforms in psychology.

	abstract = {The sample size necessary to obtain a desired level of statistical power depends in part on the population value of the effect size, which is, by definition, unknown. A common approach to sample-size planning uses the sample effect size from a prior study as an estimate of the population value of the effect to be detected in the future study. Although this strategy is intuitively appealing, effect-size estimates, taken at face value, are typically not accurate estimates of the population effect size because of publication bias and uncertainty. We show that the use of this approach often results in underpowered studies, sometimes to an alarming degree. We present an alternative approach that adjusts sample effect sizes for bias and uncertainty, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for several experimental designs. Furthermore, we discuss an open-source R package, BUCSS, and user-friendly Web applications that we have made available to researchers so that they can easily implement our suggested methods.},

	abstract = {Objective Publication bias undermines the integrity of published research. The aim of this paper is to present a synopsis of methods for exploring and accounting for publication bias.
Methods We discussed the main features of the following methods to assess publication bias: funnel plot analysis; trim-and-fill methods; regression techniques and selection models. We applied these methods to a well-known example of antidepressants trials that compared trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for regulatory approval.
Results The funnel plot-related methods (visual inspection, trim-and-fill, regression models) revealed an association between effect size and SE. Contours of statistical significance showed that asymmetry in the funnel plot is probably due to publication bias. Selection model found a significant correlation between effect size and propensity for publication.
Conclusions Researchers should always consider the possible impact of publication bias. Funnel plot-related methods should be seen as a means of examining for small-study effects and not be directly equated with publication bias. Possible causes for funnel plot asymmetry should be explored. Contours of statistical significance may help disentangle whether asymmetry in a funnel plot is caused by publication bias or not. Selection models, although underused, could be useful resource when publication bias and heterogeneity are suspected because they address directly the problem of publication bias and not that of small-study effects.},

Our simulation covers both restrictive settings as well as more realistic settings and proceeds across multiple metrics that assess different aspects of model performance. This evaluation is timely in light of two recently proposed approaches, the so-called p-curve and p-uniform approaches, that can be viewed as alternative implementations of the original Hedges selection method approach. We find that the p-curve and p-uniform approaches perform reasonably well but not as well as the original Hedges approach in the restrictive setting for which all three were designed. We also find they perform poorly in more realistic settings, whereas variants of the Hedges approach perform well. We conclude by urging caution in the application of selection methods: Given the idealistic model assumptions underlying selection methods and the sensitivity of population average effect size estimates to them, we advocate that selection methods should be used less for obtaining a single estimate that purports to adjust for publication bias ex post and more for sensitivity analysis?that is, exploring the range of estimates that result from assuming different forms of and severity of publication bias.},

	abstract = {The generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach is widely used in regression analyses with correlated response data. Under mild conditions, the resulting regression coefficient estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal with its variance being consistently estimated by the so-called sandwich estimator. Statistical inference is thus accomplished by using the asymptotic Wald chi-squared test. However, it has been noted in the literature that for small samples the sandwich estimator may not perform well and may lead to much inflated type I errors for the Wald chi-squared test. Here we propose using an approximate t- or F-test that takes account of the variability of the sandwich estimator. The level of type I error of the proposed t- or F-test is guaranteed to be no larger than that of the Wald chi-squared test. The satisfactory performance of the proposed new tests is confirmed in a simulation study. Our proposal also has some advantages when compared with other new approaches based on direct modifications of the sandwich estimator, including the one that corrects the downward bias of the sandwich estimator. In addition to hypothesis testing, our result has a clear implication on constructing Wald-type confidence intervals or regions. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Publication bias threatens the validity of meta-analytic results and leads to overestimation of the effect size in traditional meta-analysis. This particularly applies to meta-analyses that feature small studies, which are ubiquitous in psychology. Here we develop a new method for meta-analysis that deals with publication bias. This method, p-uniform, enables (a) testing of publication bias, (b) effect size estimation, and (c) testing of the null-hypothesis of no effect. No current method for meta-analysis possesses all 3 qualities. Application of p-uniform is straightforward because no additional data on missing studies are needed and no sophisticated assumptions or choices need to be made before applying it. Simulations show that p-uniform generally outperforms the trim-and-fill method and the test of excess significance (TES; Ioannidis \& Trikalinos, 2007b) if publication bias exists and population effect size is homogenous or heterogeneity is slight. For illustration, p-uniform and other publication bias analyses are applied to the meta-analysis of McCall and Carriger (1993) examining the association between infants' habituation to a stimulus and their later cognitive ability (IQ). We conclude that p-uniform is a valuable technique for examining publication bias and estimating population effects in fixed-effect meta-analyses, and as sensitivity analysis to draw inferences about publication bias.},

	abstract = {Brain-Wide Association Studies (BWAS) have become a dominant method for linking mind and brain over the past 30 years. Univariate models test tens to hundreds of thousands of brain voxels individually, whereas multivariate models (‘multivariate BWAS’) integrate signals across brain regions into a predictive model. Numerous problems have been raised with univariate BWAS, including lack of power and reliability and an inability to account for pattern-level information embedded in distributed neural circuits1–3. Multivariate predictive models address many of these concerns, and offer substantial promise for delivering brain-based measures of behavioral and clinical states and traits2,3.
In their recent paper4, Marek et al. evaluated the effects of sample size on univariate and multivariate BWAS in three large-scale neuroimaging dataset and came to the general conclusion that “BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals”. We applaud their comprehensive analysis, and we agree that (a) large samples are needed when conducting univariate BWAS of individual differences in trait measures, and (b) multivariate BWAS reveal substantially larger effects and are therefore more highly powered. However, we disagree with Marek et al.’s claims that multivariate BWAS provide “inflated in-sample associations” that often fail to replicate (i.e., are underpowered), and that multivariate BWAS consequently require thousands of participants when predicting trait-level individual differences. Here we substantiate that (i) with appropriate methodology, the reported in-sample effect size inflation in multivariate BWAS can be entirely eliminated, and (ii) in most cases, multivariate BWAS effects are replicable with substantially smaller sample sizes (Figure 1).},

This study’s aims were to 1) describe the distribution of effect sizes across multiple instruments, 2) consider factors qualifying the effect size distribution, and 3) identify examples as benchmarks for various effect sizes. For aim one, effect size distributions were illustrated from a large, diverse sample of 9/10-year-old children. This was done by conducting Pearson’s correlations among 161 variables representing constructs from all questionnaires and tasks from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study® baseline data. To achieve aim two, factors qualifying this distribution were tested by comparing the distributions of effect size among various modifications of the aim one analyses. These modified analytic strategies included comparisons of effect size distributions for different types of variables, for analyses using statistical thresholds, and for analyses using several covariate strategies. In aim one analyses, the median in-sample effect size was .03, and values at the first and third quartiles were .01 and .07. In aim two analyses, effects were smaller for associations across instruments, content domains, and reporters, as well as when covarying for sociodemographic factors. Effect sizes were larger when thresholding for statistical significance. In analyses intended to mimic conditions used in “real-world” analysis of ABCD data, the median in-sample effect size was .05, and values at the first and third quartiles were .03 and .09. To achieve aim three, examples for varying effect sizes are reported from the ABCD dataset as benchmarks for future work in the dataset. In summary, this report finds that empirically determined effect sizes from a notably large dataset are smaller than would be expected based on existing heuristics.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly being applied to neuroimaging data. However, most machine learning algorithms have not been designed to accommodate neuroimaging data, which typically has many more data points than subjects, in addition to multicollinearity and low signal-to-noise. Consequently, the relative efficacy of different machine learning regression algorithms for different types of neuroimaging data are not known. Here, we sought to quantify the performance of a variety of machine learning algorithms for use with neuroimaging data with various sample sizes, feature set sizes, and predictor effect sizes. The contribution of additional machine learning techniques – embedded feature selection and bootstrap aggregation (bagging) – to model performance was also quantified. Five machine learning regression methods – Gaussian Process Regression, Multiple Kernel Learning, Kernel Ridge Regression, the Elastic Net and Random Forest, were examined with both real and simulated MRI data, and in comparison to standard multiple regression. The different machine learning regression algorithms produced varying results, which depended on sample size, feature set size, and predictor effect size. When the effect size was large, the Elastic Net, Kernel Ridge Regression and Gaussian Process Regression performed well at most sample sizes and feature set sizes. However, when the effect size was small, only the Elastic Net made accurate predictions, but this was limited to analyses with sample sizes greater than 400. Random Forest also produced a moderate performance for small effect sizes, but could do so across all sample sizes. Machine learning techniques also improved prediction accuracy for multiple regression. These data provide empirical evidence for the differential performance of various machines on neuroimaging data, which are dependent on number of sample size, features and effect size.},

	abstract = {The neuroimaging community has witnessed a paradigm shift in biomarker discovery from using traditional univariate brain mapping approaches to multivariate predictive models, allowing the field to move toward a translational neuroscience era. Regression-based multivariate models (hereafter “predictive modeling”) provide a powerful and widely used approach to predict human behavior with neuroimaging features. These studies maintain a focus on decoding individual differences in a continuously behavioral phenotype from neuroimaging data, opening up an exciting opportunity to describe the human brain at the single-subject level. In this survey, we provide an overview of recent studies that utilize machine learning approaches to identify neuroimaging predictors over the past decade. We first review regression-based approaches and highlight connectome-based predictive modeling, which has grown in popularity in recent years. Next, we systematically describe recent representative studies using these tools in the context of cognitive function, symptom severity, personality traits, and emotion processing. Finally, we highlight a few challenges related to combining multimodal data, longitudinal prediction, external validations, and the employment of deep learning methods that have emerged from our review of the existing literature, as well as present some promising and challenging future directions.},

In this study, we developed a functional magnetic resonance imaging signature based on whole-brain functional connectivity that tracks experimentally induced tonic pain intensity and tested its sensitivity, specificity and generalizability to clinical pain across six studies (total n = 334). The signature displayed high sensitivity and specificity to tonic pain across three independent studies of orofacial tonic pain and aversive taste. It also predicted clinical pain severity and classified patients versus controls in two independent studies of clinical low back pain. Tonic and clinical pain showed similar network-level representations, particularly in somatomotor, frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks. These patterns were distinct from representations of experimental phasic pain. This study identified a brain biomarker for sustained pain with high potential for clinical translation.},

Current treatments rely primarily on interventions that target brain function (drugs) or learning processes (psychotherapy). A mechanistic understanding of how these interventions mediate their therapeutic effects remains elusive. From the early 1990s, non-invasive functional neuroimaging, coupled with parallel developments in the cognitive neurosciences, seemed to signal a new era of neurobiologically grounded diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry. Yet, despite three decades of intense neuroimaging research, we still lack a neurobiological account for any psychiatric condition. Likewise, functional neuroimaging plays no role in clinical decision making. Here, we offer a critical commentary on this impasse and suggest how the field might fare better and deliver impactful neurobiological insights.},

We begin with a brief introduction to the general problem of causal inference, and go on to discuss estimation and inference for causal effects under semiparametric models, which allow parts of the data-generating process to be unrestricted if they are not of particular interest (i.e., nuisance functions). These models are very useful in causal problems because the outcome process is often complex and difficult to model, and there may only be information available about the treatment process (at best). Semiparametric theory gives a framework for benchmarking efficiency and constructing estimators in such settings. In the second part of the paper we discuss empirical process theory, which provides powerful tools for understanding the asymptotic behavior of semiparametric estimators that depend on flexible nonparametric estimators of nuisance functions. These tools are crucial for incorporating machine learning and other modern methods into causal inference analyses. We conclude by examining related extensions and future directions for work in semiparametric causal inference.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of treatment effects and more general estimands is typically achieved via parametric modeling, which is unsatisfactory since model misspecification is likely. Data-adaptive model building (e.g., statistical/machine learning) is commonly employed to reduce the risk of misspecification. Naïve use of such methods, however, delivers estimators whose bias may shrink too slowly with sample size for inferential methods to perform well, including those based on the bootstrap. Bias arises because standard data-adaptive methods are tuned toward minimal prediction error as opposed to, for example, minimal MSE in the estimator. This may cause excess variability that is difficult to acknowledge, due to the complexity of such strategies. Building on results from nonparametric statistics, targeted learning and debiased machine learning overcome these problems by constructing estimators using the estimand’s efficient influence function under the nonparametric model. These increasingly popular methodologies typically assume that the efficient influence function is given, or that the reader is familiar with its derivation. In this article, we focus on derivation of the efficient influence function and explain how it may be used to construct statistical/machine-learning-based estimators. We discuss the requisite conditions for these estimators to perform well and use diverse examples to convey the broad applicability of the theory.},

	abstract = {A central goal of translational neuroimaging is to establish robust links between brain measures and clinical outcomes. Success hinges on the development of brain biomarkers with large effect sizes. With large enough effects, a measure may be diagnostic of outcomes at the individual patient level. Surprisingly, however, standard brain-mapping analyses are not designed to estimate or optimize the effect sizes of brain-outcome relationships, and estimates are often biased. Here, we review these issues and how to estimate effect sizes in neuroimaging research.Effect size is a unit-free description of the strength of an effect, independent of sample size. Examples include Cohen d, Pearson r, and number needed to treat. For a given sample size (N), these can be converted to a t or z score (eg, Cohen d is t/[N]1/2). But t, z, F, and P values are sample size dependent and relate to the presence of an effect (statistical significance), not its magnitude. By contrast, effect size describes a finding’s practical significance, which determines its clinical importance. This is an important distinction because small effects can reach statistical significance given a large enough sample, even if they are unlikely to be of practical importance or replicable across diverse samples.},

To empirically evaluate for evidence of excessive significance bias in this literature, we searched for published fMRI studies of human brain to evaluate sex differences, regardless of the topic investigated, in Medline and Scopus over 10 years. We analyzed the prevalence of conclusions in favor of sex differences and the correlation between study sample sizes and number of significant foci identified. In the absence of bias, larger studies (better powered) should identify a larger number of significant foci. Across 179 papers, median sample size was n = 32 (interquartile range 23-47.5). A median of 5 foci related to sex differences were reported (interquartile range, 2-9.5). Few articles (n = 2) had titles focused on no differences or on similarities (n = 3) between sexes. Overall, 158 papers (88\%) reached “positive” conclusions in their abstract and presented some foci related to sex differences. There was no statistically significant relationship between sample size and the number of foci (−0.048\% increase for every 10 participants, p = 0.63). The extremely high prevalence of “positive” results and the lack of the expected relationship between sample size and the number of discovered foci reflect probable reporting bias and excess significance bias in this literature.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional MRI and voxel-based morphometry are important in neuroscience. They are technically challenging with no globally optimal analysis method, and the multiple approaches have been shown to produce different results. It is useful to be able to meta-analyse results from such studies that tested a similar hypothesis potentially using different analysis methods. The aim is to identify replicable results and infer hypothesis specific effects. Coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA) offers this, but the multiple algorithms can produce different results, making interpretation conditional on the algorithm.
NEW METHOD: Here a new model based CBMA algorithm, Analysis of Brain Coordinates (ABC), is presented. ABC aims to be simple to understand by avoiding empirical elements where possible and by using a simple to interpret statistical threshold, which relates to the primary aim of detecting replicable effects.
RESULTS: ABC is compared to both the most used and the most recently developed CBMA algorithms, by reproducing a published meta-analysis of localised grey matter changes in schizophrenia. There are some differences in results and the type of data that can be analysed, which are related to the algorithm specifics.
COMPARISON TO OTHER METHODS: Compared to other algorithms ABC eliminates empirical elements where possible and uses a simple to interpret statistical threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: There may be no optimal way to meta-analyse neuroimaging studies using CBMA. However, by eliminating some empirical elements and relating the statistical threshold directly to the aim of finding replicable effects, ABC makes the impact of the algorithm on any conclusion easier to understand.},

	abstract = {A widely used technique for coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data is activation likelihood estimation (ALE), which determines the convergence of foci reported from different experiments. ALE analysis involves modelling these foci as probability distributions whose width is based on empirical estimates of the spatial uncertainty due to the between-subject and between-template variability of neuroimaging data. ALE results are assessed against a null-distribution of random spatial association between experiments, resulting in random-effects inference. In the present revision of this algorithm, we address two remaining drawbacks of the previous algorithm. First, the assessment of spatial association between experiments was based on a highly time-consuming permutation test, which nevertheless entailed the danger of underestimating the right tail of the null-distribution. In this report, we outline how this previous approach may be replaced by a faster and more precise analytical method. Second, the previously applied correction procedure, i.e. controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), is supplemented by new approaches for correcting the family-wise error rate and the cluster-level significance. The different alternatives for drawing inference on meta-analytic results are evaluated on an exemplary dataset on face perception as well as discussed with respect to their methodological limitations and advantages. In summary, we thus replaced the previous permutation algorithm with a faster and more rigorous analytical solution for the null-distribution and comprehensively address the issue of multiple-comparison corrections. The proposed revision of the ALE-algorithm should provide an improved tool for conducting coordinate-based meta-analyses on functional imaging data.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of neuroimaging research and accumulation of neuroinformatic databases the synthesis of consensus findings using meta-analysis is becoming increasingly important. Meta-analyses pool data across many studies to identify reliable experimental effects and characterize the degree of agreement across studies. Coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA) methods are the standard approach, where each study entered into the meta-analysis has been summarized using only the (x, y, z) locations of peak activations (with or without activation magnitude) reported in published reports. Image-based meta-analysis (IBMA) methods use the full statistic images, and allow the use of hierarchical mixed effects models that account for differing intra-study variance and modeling of random inter-study variation. The purpose of this work is to compare image-based and coordinate-based meta-analysis methods applied to the same dataset, a group of 15 fMRI studies of pain, and to quantify the information lost by working only with the coordinates of peak activations instead of the full statistic images. We apply a 3-level IBMA mixed model for a "mega-analysis", and highlight important considerations in the specification of each model and contrast. We compare the IBMA result to three CBMA methods: ALE (activation likelihood estimation), KDA (kernel density analysis) and MKDA (multi-level kernel density analysis), for various CBMA smoothing parameters. For the datasets considered, we find that ALE at σ=15 mm, KDA at ρ=25–30 mm and MKDA at ρ=15 mm give the greatest similarity to the IBMA result, and that ALE was the most similar for this particular dataset, though only with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.45 (Dice measure ranges from 0 to 1). Based on this poor similarity, and the greater modeling flexibility afforded by hierarchical mixed models, we suggest that IBMA is preferred over CBMA. To make IBMA analyses practical, however, the neuroimaging field needs to develop an effective mechanism for sharing image data, including whole-brain images of both effect estimates and their standard errors.},

	abstract = {The number of neuroimaging studies has grown exponentially in recent years and their results are not always consistent. Meta-analyses are helpful to summarize this vast literature and also offer insights that are not apparent from the individual studies. In this review, we describe the main methods used for meta-analyzing neuroimaging data, with special emphasis on their relative advantages and disadvantages. We describe and discuss meta-analytical methods for global brain volumes, methods based on regions of interest, label-based reviews, voxel-based meta-analytic methods and online databases. Regions of interest-based methods allow for optimal statistical analyses but are affected by a limited and potentially biased inclusion of brain regions, whilst voxel-based methods benefit from a more exhaustive and unbiased inclusion of studies but are statistically more limited. There are also relevant differences between the different available voxel-based meta-analytic methods, and the field is rapidly evolving to develop more accurate and robust methods. We suggest that in any meta-analysis of neuroimaging data, authors should aim to: only include studies exploring the whole brain; ensure that the same threshold throughout the whole brain is used within each included study; and explore the robustness of the findings via complementary analyses to minimize the risk of false positives.},

This approach has an unfortunate consequence on the replicability of neuroimaging findings because the targeted brain regions are affected by the sample size-larger studies have more power to detect smaller effects. Here, we use simulations based on the preprocessed Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) to show that thresholding statistical images by effect sizes has more consistent estimates of activated regions across studies than thresholding by p-values. Using a constant effect size threshold means that the p-value threshold naturally scales with the sample size to ensure that the target set is similar across repetitions of the study that use different sample sizes. As a consequence of thresholding by the effect size, the type 1 and type 2 error rates go to zero as the sample size gets larger. We use a newly proposed robust effect size index that is defined for an arbitrary statistical image so that effect size thresholding can be used regardless of the test statistic or model.},

We demonstrate that the new index is a function of Cohen's d, [Formula: see text], and standardized log odds ratio when each of the parametric models is correctly specified. We show that existing effect size estimators are biased when the parametric models are incorrect (e.g., under unknown heteroskedasticity). We provide simple formulas to compute power and sample size and use simulations to assess the bias and standard error of the effect size estimator in finite samples.

	abstract = {With the increasing availability of neuroimaging data from multiple modalities—each providing a different lens through which to study brain structure or function—new techniques for comparing, integrating, and interpreting information within and across modalities have emerged. Recent developments include hypothesis tests of associations between neuroimaging modalities, which can be used to determine the statistical significance of intermodal associations either throughout the entire brain or within anatomical subregions or functional networks. While these methods provide a crucial foundation for inference on intermodal relationships, they cannot be used to answer questions about where in the brain these associations are most pronounced. In this paper, we introduce a new method, called CLEAN-R, that can be used both to test intermodal correspondence throughout the brain and also to localize this correspondence. Our method involves first adjusting for the underlying spatial autocorrelation structure within each modality before aggregating information within small clusters to construct a map of enhanced test statistics. Using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a subsample of children and adolescents from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we conduct simulations and data analyses where we illustrate the high statistical power and nominal type I error levels of our method. By constructing an interpretable map of group-level correspondence using spatially-enhanced test statistics, our method offers insights beyond those provided by earlier methods.},

Linear mixed effects models assessed improvement in LUTS over time while accounting for known factors associated with outcome (e.g., age, gender). The interaction of baseline symptom severity and treatment assessed the potential effect of baseline symptoms on change scores. Results Participants experienced significant and meaningful improvements in LUTS following group hypnosis (p = 0.006). There was a significant interaction between baseline symptom severity and treatment (p {\textless} 0.001), such that those with severe symptoms experienced the most pronounced gains over time (e.g., an 8.8 point reduction). Gains increased over time for those with moderate and severe symptoms. Changes in LUT symptoms occurred independently of pain relief. Conclusions This pilot study suggests hypnosis has the potential to drastically improve LUTS in individuals with chronic pain, even when pain reduction does not occur.

	abstract = {Background
Hippocampal abnormalities are among the most consistent findings in schizophrenia. Numerous studies have reported deficits in hippocampal volume, function, and connectivity in the chronic stage of illness. While hippocampal volume and function deficits are also present in the early stage of illness, there is mixed evidence of both higher and lower functional connectivity. Here, we use graph theory to test the hypothesis that hippocampal network connectivity is broadly lowered in early psychosis and progressively worsens over 2 years.
Methods
We examined longitudinal resting-state functional connectivity in 140 participants (68 individuals in the early stage of psychosis, 72 demographically similar healthy control individuals). We used an anatomically driven approach to quantify hippocampal network connectivity at 2 levels: 1) a core hippocampal-medial temporal lobe cortex (MTLC) network; and 2) an extended hippocampal-cortical network. Group and time effects were tested in a linear mixed effects model.
Results
Early psychosis patients showed elevated functional connectivity in the core hippocampal-MTLC network, but contrary to our hypothesis, did not show alterations within the broader hippocampal-cortical network. Hippocampal-MTLC network hyperconnectivity normalized longitudinally and predicted improvement in positive symptoms but was not associated with increasing illness duration.
Conclusions
These results show abnormally elevated functional connectivity in a core hippocampal-MTLC network in early psychosis, suggesting that selectively increased hippocampal signaling within a localized cortical circuit may be a marker of the early stage of psychosis. Hippocampal-MTLC hyperconnectivity could have prognostic and therapeutic implications.},

Method: In a large community sample (N = 9,138; age range 8–21), we performed a correlated-traits confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multiple exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) on the 12 CNB measures of Efficiency (which combine Accuracy and Speed). We then performed EFAs of the Accuracy and Speed measures separately. Finally, we performed a confirmatory bifactor analysis of the Efficiency scores. All analyses were performed with Mplus using maximum likelihood estimation. Results: Results strongly support the a priori theory used to construct the CNB, showing that tests designed to measure executive, episodic memory, complex cognition, and social cognition aggregate their loadings within these domains. When Accuracy and Speed were analyzed separately, Accuracy produced 3 reliable factors: executive and complex cognition, episodic memory, and social cognition, while speed produced 2 factors: tests that require fast responses and those where each item requires deliberation. The statistical “Fit” of almost all models described above was acceptable (usually excellent). Conclusions: Based on the analysis from these large-scale data, the CNB offers an effective means for measuring the integrity of intended neurocognitive domains in about 1 hour of testing and is thus suitable for large-scale clinical and genomic studies.

	abstract = {Cluster-wise inference is widely used in fMRI analysis. The cluster-level statistic is often obtained by counting the number of intra-cluster voxels which surpass a voxel-level statistical significance threshold. This measure can be sub-optimal regarding the power and false-positive error rate because the suprathreshold voxel count neglects the voxel-wise significance levels and ignores the dependence between voxels. This article aims to provide a new Integrated Cluster-wise significance Measure (ICM) for cluster-level significance determination in cluster-wise fMRI analysis by integrating cluster extent, voxel-level significance (e.g., p values), and activation dependence between within-cluster voxels. We develop a computationally efficient strategy for ICM based on probabilistic approximation theories. Consequently, the computational load for ICM-based cluster-wise inference (e.g., permutation tests) is affordable. We validate the proposed method via extensive simulations and then apply it to two fMRI data sets. The results demonstrate that ICM can improve the power with well-controlled family-wise error (FWE).},

We recently proposed a robust effect size index (RESI) that is advantageous over common indices because it's widely applicable to different types of data. Here, we use statistical theory and simulations to develop and evaluate RESI estimators and confidence/credible intervals that rely on different covariance estimators. Our results show (1) counter to intuition, the randomness of covariates reduces coverage for Chi-squared and F CIs; (2) when the variance of the estimators is estimated, the non-central Chi-squared and F CIs using the parametric and robust RESI estimators fail to cover the true effect size at the nominal level. Using the robust estimator along with the proposed nonparametric bootstrap or Bayesian (credible) intervals provides valid inference for the RESI, even when model assumptions may be violated. This work forms a unified effect size reporting procedure, such that effect sizes with confidence/credible intervals can be easily reported in an analysis of variance (ANOVA) table format.},

Common methods in functional magnetic resonance imaging to control the familywise error rate (FWER) include random field theory (RFT) and permutation testing. The ability of these methods to control the FWER in optical neuroimaging has not been evaluated.AimWe attempt to control the FWER in optical intrinsic signal imaging resting-state functional connectivity using both RFT and permutation inference at a nominal value of 0.05. The FWER was derived using a mass empirical analysis of real data in which the null is known to be true.ApproachData from normal mice were repeatedly divided into two groups, and differences between functional connectivity maps were calculated with pixel-wise t-tests. As the null hypothesis was always true, all positives were false positives.ResultsGaussian RFT resulted in a higher than expected FWER with either cluster-based (0.15) or pixel-based (0.62) methods. t-distribution RFT could achieve FWERs of 0.05 (cluster-based or pixel-based). Permutation inference always controlled the FWER.ConclusionsRFT can lead to highly inflated FWERs. Although t-distribution RFT can be accurate, it is sensitive to statistical assumptions. Permutation inference is robust to statistical errors and accurately controls the FWER.},

	abstract = {When individual subjects are imaged with multiple modalities, biological information is present not only within each modality, but also between modalities – that is, in how modalities covary at the voxel level. Previous studies have shown that local covariance structures between modalities, or intermodal coupling (IMCo), can be summarized for two modalities, and that two-modality IMCo reveals otherwise undiscovered patterns in neurodevelopment and certain diseases. However, previous IMCo methods are based on the slopes of local weighted linear regression lines, which are inherently asymmetric and limited to the two-modality setting. Here, we present a generalization of IMCo estimation which uses local covariance decompositions to define a symmetric, voxel-wise coupling coefficient that is valid for two or more modalities. We use this method to study coupling between cerebral blood flow, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, and local connectivity in 803 subjects ages 8 through 22. We demonstrate that coupling is spatially heterogeneous, varies with respect to age and sex in neurodevelopment, and reveals patterns that are not present in individual modalities. As availability of multi-modal data continues to increase, principal-component-based IMCo (pIMCo) offers a powerful approach for summarizing relationships between multiple aspects of brain structure and function.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Significant progress has been made since the first report of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in 1859, after decades of research that have contributed to the understanding of the genetic and environmental factors involved in IBD pathogenesis. Today, a range of treatments is available for directed therapy, mostly targeting the overactive immune response. However, the mechanisms by which the immune system contributes to disease pathogenesis and progression are not fully understood. One challenge hindering IBD research is the heterogeneous nature of the disease and the lack of understanding of how immune cells interact with one another in the gut mucosa. Introduction of a technology that enables expansive characterization of the inflammatory environment of human IBD tissues may address this gap in knowledge.
METHODS: We used the imaging mass cytometry platform to perform highly multiplex image analysis of IBD and healthy deidentified intestine sections (6 Crohn's disease compared to 6 control ileum; 6 ulcerative colitis compared to 6 control colon). The acquired images were graded for inflammation severity by analysis of adjacent H\&E tissue sections. We assigned more than 300,000 cells to unique cell types and performed analyses of tissue integrity, epithelial activity, and immune cell composition.
RESULTS: The intestinal epithelia of patients with IBD exhibited increased proliferation rates and expression of HLA-DR compared to control tissues, and both features were positively correlated with the severity of inflammation. The neighborhood analysis determined enrichment of regulatory T cell interactions with CD68+ macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and plasma cells in both forms of IBD, whereas activated lysozyme C+ macrophages were preferred regulatory T cell neighbors in Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our study shows the power of imaging mass cytometry and its ability to both quantify immune cell types and characterize their spatial interactions within the inflammatory environment by a single analysis platform.},

Recent approaches using linear mixed effects (LME) models in longitudinal neuroimaging have been powerful and flexible in investigating the temporal trajectories of cortical thickness. However, massive-univariate analysis, a simplified approach that obtains a summary statistic (e.g., a p-value) for every vertex along the cortex, is insufficient to model cortical atrophy because it does not account for spatial similarities of the signals in neighboring locations. In this article, we develop a permutation-based inference procedure to detect spatial clusters of vertices showing statistically significant differences in the rates of cortical atrophy. The proposed method, called SpLoc, uses spatial information to combine the signals adaptively across neighboring vertices, yielding high statistical power while controlling family-wise error rate (FWER) accurately. When we reject the global null hypothesis, we use a cluster selection algorithm to detect the spatial clusters of significant vertices. We validate our method using simulation studies and apply it to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to show its superior performance over existing methods. An R package for implementing SpLoc is publicly available.},

Specifically, we will characterize the spatial arrangement of immune and malignant epithelial (tumor) cells within the breast cancer immune microenvironment. Quantitative and robust characterizations are built by computing persistence diagrams from quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence, which is a technology which allows us to obtain spatial coordinates and protein intensities on individual cells. The resulting persistence diagrams are evaluated as characteristic biomarkers predictive of cancer subtype and prognostic of overall survival. For a cohort of approximately 700 breast cancer patients with median 8.5-year clinical follow-up, we show that these persistence diagrams outperform and complement the usual descriptors which capture spatial relationships with nearest neighbor analysis. Our results thus suggest new methods which can be used to build topology-based biomarkers which are characteristic and predictive of cancer subtype and response to therapy as well as prognostic of overall survival.},

	abstract = {Multiplex imaging is a powerful tool to analyze the structural and functional states of cells in their morphological and pathological contexts. However, hypothesis testing with multiplex imaging data is a challenging task due to the extent and complexity of the information obtained. Various computational pipelines have been developed and validated to extract knowledge from specific imaging platforms. A common problem with customized pipelines is their reduced applicability across different imaging platforms: Every multiplex imaging technique exhibits platform-specific characteristics in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and acquisition artifacts that need to be accounted for to yield reliable and reproducible results. We propose a pixel classifier-based image preprocessing step that aims to minimize platform-dependency for all multiplex image analysis pipelines. Signal detection and noise reduction as well as artifact removal can be posed as a pixel classification problem in which all pixels in multiplex images can be assigned to two general classes of either I) signal of interest or II) artifacts and noise. The resulting feature representation maps contain pixel-accurate representations of the input data, but exhibit signifi-cantly increased signal-to-noise ratios with normalized pixel values as output data. We demonstrate the validity of our proposed image preprocessing approach by comparing the results of two well-accepted and widely-used image analysis pipelines.},

	abstract = {Advanced solid cancers are complex assemblies of tumor, immune, and stromal cells characterized by high intratumoral variation. We use highly multiplexed tissue imaging, 3D reconstruction, spatial statistics, and machine learning to identify cell types and states underlying morphological features of known diagnostic and prognostic significance in colorectal cancer. Quantitation of these features in high-plex marker space reveals recurrent transitions from one tumor morphology to the next, some of which are coincident with long-range gradients in the expression of oncogenes and epigenetic regulators. At the tumor invasive margin, where tumor, normal, and immune cells compete, T cell suppression involves multiple cell types and 3D imaging shows that seemingly localized 2D features such as tertiary lymphoid structures are commonly interconnected and have graded molecular properties. Thus, while cancer genetics emphasizes the importance of discrete changes in tumor state, whole-specimen imaging reveals large-scale morphological and molecular gradients analogous to those in developing tissues.},

To understand the spatial organization of tissue and how it relates to disease processes, imaging studies typically focus on cell-level phenotypes. However, images can capture biologically important objects that are outside of cells, such as the extracellular matrix. Here, we developed a pipeline, Pixie, that achieves robust and quantitative annotation of pixel-level features using unsupervised clustering and show its application across a variety of biological contexts and multiplexed imaging platforms. Furthermore, current cell phenotyping strategies that rely on unsupervised clustering can be labor intensive and require large amounts of manual adjustments. We demonstrate how pixel clusters that lie within cells can be used to improve cell annotations and decrease the amount of manual fine-tuning needed. We comprehensively evaluate pre-processing steps and parameter choices to optimize clustering performance and quantify the reproducibility of our method. Importantly, Pixie is open source and easily customizable through a user-friendly interface.},

However, cell classification, the task of identifying the type of individual cells, remains challenging, labor-intensive, and limiting to throughput. Here, we present CellSighter, a deep-learning based pipeline to accelerate cell classification in multiplexed images. Given a small training set of expert-labeled images, CellSighter outputs the label probabilities for all cells in new images. CellSighter achieves over 80\% accuracy for major cell types across imaging platforms, which approaches inter-observer concordance. Ablation studies and simulations show that CellSighter is able to generalize its training data and learn features of protein expression levels, as well as spatial features such as subcellular expression patterns. CellSighter’s design reduces overfitting, and it can be trained with only thousands or even hundreds of labeled examples. CellSighter also outputs a prediction confidence, allowing downstream experts control over the results. Altogether, CellSighter drastically reduces hands-on time for cell classification in multiplexed images, while improving accuracy and consistency across datasets.},

As a result, higher-order patterns of tissue organization are poorly understood and not systematically connected to disease pathology or clinical outcomes. To address this gap, we developed an approach called UTAG to identify and quantify microanatomical tissue structures in multiplexed images without human intervention. Our method combines information on cellular phenotypes with the physical proximity of cells to accurately identify organ-specific microanatomical domains in healthy and diseased tissue. We apply our method to various types of images across healthy and disease states to show that it can consistently detect higher-level architectures in human tissues, quantify structural differences between healthy and diseased tissue, and reveal tissue organization patterns at the organ scale.},

Furthermore, by assuming spatial coherence among neighboring microenvironments our model limits the number of parameters that need to be learned and permits data-driven decisions about the size of cellular neighborhoods. We apply this method to uncover anatomically known structures in mouse spleen—identifying distinct population of spleen B cells that are defined by their characteristic neighborhoods. Next, we apply the method to a dataset of triple-negative breast cancer tumors from 41 patients to study the structure of tumor-immune boundary. We uncover previously reported tumor-immune microenvironment near the tumor-immune boundary enriched for immune cells with high Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and a novel, immunosuppressed, microenvironment-enriched for cells expressing CD45 and FoxP3.},

We demonstrate the performance of CELESTA on multiplexed immunofluorescence images of colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Using the cell types identified by CELESTA, we identify tissue architecture associated with lymph node metastasis in HNSCC, and validate our findings in an independent cohort. By coupling our spatial analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing data on proximal sections of the same specimens, we identify cell–cell crosstalk associated with lymph node metastasis, demonstrating the power of CELESTA to facilitate identification of clinically relevant interactions.},

If findings are not replicable, then prediction and theory development are stifled. If findings are replicable, then interrogation of their meaning and validity can advance knowledge. Assessing replicability can be productive for generating and testing hypotheses by actively confronting current understandings to identify weaknesses and spur innovation. For psychology, the 2010s might be characterized as a decade of active confrontation. Systematic and multi-site replication projects assessed current understandings and observed surprising failures to replicate many published findings. Replication efforts highlighted sociocultural challenges such as disincentives to conduct replications and a tendency to frame replication as a personal attack rather than a healthy scientific practice, and they raised awareness that replication contributes to self-correction. Nevertheless, innovation in doing and understanding replication and its cousins, reproducibility and robustness, has positioned psychology to improve research practices and accelerate progress.},

Despite the careful and nuanced analysis reported, the simple narrative disseminated by the mass, social, and scientific media was that in only 36\% of the studies were the original results replicated. In the current study, however, we showed that 77\% of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95\% prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers? intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervals?and a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates. This may lead to effects that replicate successfully, in that replication results are consistent with statistical expectations, but do not provide much information about the size (or existence) of the true effect. In this light, the results of the Reproducibility Project: Psychology can be viewed as statistically consistent with what one might expect when performing a large-scale replication experiment.},

Critical considerations relating to statistical power include challenges in recruitment and testing of young populations, how to increase the value of studies with small samples, and the opportunities and challenges related to working with large-scale datasets. Developmental studies involve challenges such as choices about age groupings, lifespan modelling, analyses of longitudinal changes, and data that can be processed and analyzed in a multitude of ways. Flexibility in data acquisition, analyses and description may thereby greatly impact results. We discuss methods for improving transparency in developmental neuroimaging, and how preregistration can improve methodological rigor. While outlining challenges and issues that may arise before, during, and after data collection, solutions and resources are highlighted aiding to overcome some of these. Since the number of useful tools and techniques is ever-growing, we highlight the fact that many practices can be implemented stepwise.},

	abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology’s lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and large-N designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

	abstract = {Introduction Statistical effect sizes are systematically overestimated in small samples, leading to poor generalizability and replicability of findings in all areas of research. Due to the large number of variables, this is particularly problematic in neuroimaging research. While cross-validation is frequently used in multivariate machine learning approaches to assess model generalizability and replicability, the benefits for mass-univariate brain analysis are yet unclear. We investigated the impact of cross-validation on effect size estimation in univariate voxel-based brain-wide associations, using body mass index (BMI) as an exemplary predictor.
Methods A total of n=3401 adults were pooled from three independent cohorts. Brain-wide associations between BMI and gray matter structure were tested using a standard linear mass-univariate voxel-based approach. First, a traditional non-cross-validated analysis was conducted to identify brain-wide effect sizes in the total sample (as an estimate of a realistic reference effect size). The impact of sample size (bootstrapped samples ranging from n=25 to n=3401) and cross-validation on effect size estimates was investigated across selected voxels with differing underlying effect sizes (including the brain-wide lowest effect size). Linear effects were estimated within training sets and then applied to unseen test set data, using 5-fold cross-validation. Resulting effect sizes (explained variance) were investigated.
Results Analysis in the total sample (n=3401) without cross-validation yielded mainly negative correlations between BMI and gray matter density with a maximum effect size of R2p=.036 (peak voxel in the cerebellum). Effects were overestimated exponentially with decreasing sample size, with effect sizes up to R2p=.535 in samples of n=25 for the voxel with the brain-wide largest effect and up to R2p=.429 for the voxel with the brain-wide smallest effect. When applying cross-validation, linear effects estimated in small samples did not generalize to an independent test set. For the largest brain-wide effect a minimum sample size of n=100 was required to start generalizing (explained variance {\textgreater}0 in unseen data), while n=400 were needed for smaller effects of R2p =.005 to generalize. For a voxel with an underlying null effect, linear effects found in non-cross-validated samples did not generalize to test sets even with the maximum sample size of n=3401. Effect size estimates obtained with and without cross-validation approached convergence in large samples.
Discussion Cross-validation is a useful method to counteract the overestimation of effect size particularly in small samples and to assess the generalizability of effects. Train and test set effect sizes converge in large samples which likely reflects a good generalizability for models in such samples. While linear effects start generalizing to unseen data in samples of n{\textgreater}100 for large effect sizes, the generalization of smaller effects requires larger samples (n{\textgreater}400). Cross-validation should be applied in voxel-based mass-univariate analysis to foster accurate effect size estimation and improve replicability of neuroimaging findings.

Early findings, however, revealed a more complex genetic architecture than was anticipated for most common diseases — complexity that seemed to limit the immediate utility of these findings. As a result, the practice of utilizing the DNA of an individual to predict disease has been judged to provide little to no useful information. Nevertheless, recent efforts have begun to demonstrate the utility of polygenic risk profiling to identify groups of individuals who could benefit from the knowledge of their probabilistic susceptibility to disease. In this context, we review the evidence supporting the personal and clinical utility of polygenic risk profiling.},

	abstract = {However, a successful replication does not guarantee that the original scientific results of a study were correct, nor does a single failed replication conclusively refute the original claims. A failure to replicate previous results can be due to any number of factors, including the discovery of an unknown effect, inherent variability in the system, inability to control complex variables, substandard research practices, and, quite simply, chance. The nature of the problem under study and the prior likelihoods of possible results in the study, the type of measurement instruments and research design selected, and the novelty of the area of study and therefore lack of established methods of inquiry can also contribute to non-replicability. Because of the complicated relationship between replicability and its variety of sources, the validity of scientific results should be considered in the context of an entire body of evidence, rather than an individual study or an individual replication. Moreover, replication may be a matter of degree, rather than a binary result of “success” or “failure.”1 We explain in Chapter 7 how research synthesis, especially meta-analysis, can be used to evaluate the evidence on a given question.},

Previous research on two-phase studies has focused largely on the inference procedures rather than the design aspects. We investigate the design efficiency of the two-phase study, as measured by the semiparametric efficiency bound for estimating the regression coefficients of expensive covariates. We consider general two-phase studies, where the outcome variable can be continuous, discrete, or censored, and the second-phase sampling can depend on the first-phase data in any manner. We develop optimal or approximately optimal two-phase designs, which can be substantially more efficient than the existing designs.

In this article, we introduce valid design and analysis methods that permit outcome dependent sampling of longitudinal data for scenarios where all outcome data currently exist, but a targeted substudy is being planned in order to collect additional key exposure information on a limited number of subjects. We propose a stratified sampling based on specific summaries of individual longitudinal trajectories, and we detail an ascertainment corrected maximum likelihood approach for estimation using the resulting biased sample of subjects. In addition, we demonstrate that the efficiency of an outcome-based sampling design relative to use of a simple random sample depends highly on the choice of outcome summary statistic used to direct sampling, and we show a natural link between the goals of the longitudinal regression model and corresponding desirable designs. Using data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program, where genetic information required retrospective ascertainment, we study a range of designs that examine lung function profiles over 4 years of follow-up for children classified according to their genotype for the IL 13 cytokine.},

A cost-effective solution is the two-phase design, under which the outcome and inexpensive covariates are observed for all subjects during the first phase and that information is used to select subjects for measurements of expensive covariates during the second phase. For example, subjects with extreme values of quantitative traits were selected for whole-exome sequencing in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). Herein, we consider general two-phase designs, where the outcome can be continuous or discrete, and inexpensive covariates can be continuous and correlated with expensive covariates. We propose a semiparametric approach to regression analysis by approximating the conditional density functions of expensive covariates given inexpensive covariates with B-spline sieves. We devise a computationally efficient and numerically stable EM-algorithm to maximize the sieve likelihood. In addition, we establish the consistency, asymptotic normality, and asymptotic efficiency of the estimators. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over existing ones through extensive simulation studies. Finally, we present applications to the aforementioned NHLBI ESP.},

In an attempt to better describe and understand the complexities of psychiatric disorders, investigators have increasingly applied multivariate pattern classification approaches to neuroimaging data and in particular supervised machine learning methods. However, supervised machine learning approaches also come with unique challenges and trade-offs, requiring additional study design and interpretation considerations. The goal of this review is to provide a set of best practices for evaluating machine learning applications to psychiatric disorders. We discuss how to evaluate two common efforts: 1) making predictions that have the potential to aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment and 2) interrogating the complex neurophysiological mechanisms underlying psychopathology. We focus here on machine learning as applied to functional connectivity with magnetic resonance imaging, as an example to ground discussion. We argue that for machine learning classification to have translational utility for individual-level predictions, investigators must ensure that the classification is clinically informative, independent of confounding variables, and appropriately assessed for both performance and generalizability. We contend that shedding light on the complex mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders will require consideration of the unique utility, interpretability, and reliability of the neuroimaging features (e.g., regions, networks, connections) identified from machine learning approaches. Finally, we discuss how the rise of large, multisite, publicly available datasets may contribute to the utility of machine learning approaches in psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Understanding human cortical maturation is a central goal for developmental neuroscience. Significant advances toward this goal have come from two recent strands of in vivo structural magnetic resonance imaging research: (1) longitudinal study designs have revealed that factors such as sex, cognitive ability, and disease are often better related to variations in the tempo of anatomical change than to variations in anatomy at any one time point; (2) largely cross-sectional applications of new surface-based morphometry (SBM) methods have shown how the traditional focus on cortical volume (CV) can obscure information about the two evolutionarily and genetically distinct determinants of CV: cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA). Here, by combining these two strategies for the first time and applying SBM in {\textgreater}1250 longitudinally acquired brain scans from 647 healthy individuals aged 3-30 years, we deconstruct cortical development to reveal that distinct trajectories of anatomical change are hidden within, and give rise to, a curvilinear pattern of CV maturation. Developmental changes in CV emerge through the sexually dimorphic and age-dependent interaction of changes in CT and SA. Moreover, SA change itself actually reflects complex interactions between brain size-related changes in exposed cortical convex hull area, and changes in the degree of cortical gyrification, which again vary by age and sex. Knowing of these developmental dissociations, and further specifying their timing and sex-biases, provides potent new research targets for basic and clinical neuroscience.},

Describing the statistical models and methods for the analysis of longitudinal data, it covers both the underlying statistical theory of each method, and its application to a range of examples from the agricultural and biomedical sciences. The main topics discussed are design issues, exploratory methods of analysis, linear models for continuous data, general linear models for discrete data, and models and methods for handling data and missing values. Under each heading, worked examples are presented in parallel with the methodological development, and sufficient detail is given to enable the reader to reproduce the author's results using the data-sets as an appendix.

            ,  
             The first edition of Analysis for Longitudinal Data has become a classic. Describing the statistical models and methods for the analysis of longitudinal data, it covers both the underlying statistical theory of each method, and its application to a range of examples from the agricultural and biomedical sciences. The main topics discussed are design issues, exploratory methods of analysis, linear models for continuous data, general linear models for discrete data, and models and methods for handling data and missing values. Under each heading, worked examples are presented in parallel with the methodological development, and sufficient detail is given to enable the reader to reproduce the author's results using the data-sets as an appendix. This second edition, published for the first time in paperback, provides a thorough and expanded revision of this important text. It includes two new chapters; the first discusses fully parametric models for discrete repeated measures data, and the second explores statistical models for time-dependent predictors.},

	abstract = {Often in applied research, confidence intervals (CIs) are constructed or reported only for parameters selected after viewing the data. We show that such selected intervals fail to provide the assumed coverage probability. By generalizing the false discovery rate (FDR) approach from multiple testing to selected multiple CIs, we suggest the false coverage-statement rate (FCR) as a measure of interval coverage following selection. A general procedure is then introduced, offering FCR control at level q under any selection rule. The procedure constructs a marginal CI for each selected parameter, but instead of the confidence level 1 − q being used marginally, q is divided by the number of parameters considered and multiplied by the number selected. If we further use the FDR controlling testing procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg for selecting the parameters, the newly suggested procedure offers CIs that are dual to the testing procedure and are shown to be optimal in the independent case. Under the positive regression dependency condition of Benjamini and Yekutieli, the FCR is controlled for one-sided tests and CIs, as well as for a modification for two-sided testing. Results for general dependency are also given. Finally, using the equivalence of the CIs to testing, we prove that the procedure of Benjamini and Hochberg offers directional FDR control as conjectured.},

	abstract = {Brain-wide association studies (BWAS) are a fundamental tool in discovering brain-behavior associations. Several recent studies showed that thousands of study participants are required to improve the replicability of BWAS because actual effect sizes are much smaller than those reported in smaller studies. Here, we perform a meta-analysis of a robust effect size index (RESI) using 63 longitudinal and cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging studies (75,255 total scans) to demonstrate that optimizing study design is an important way to improve standardized effect sizes in BWAS. Our results of brain volume associations with demographic and cognitive variables indicate that BWAS with larger standard deviation of the independent variable have larger effect size estimates and that longitudinal studies have systematically larger standardized effect sizes than cross-sectional studies by 290\%. We propose a crosssectional RESI to adjust for the systematic difference in effect sizes between cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that allows investigators to quantify the benefit of conducting their study longitudinally. Using bootstrapping in the Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium we show that modifying study design to increase between-subject standard deviation by 45\% increases standardized effect sizes by 42\% and adding a second measurement per subject can increase effect sizes by 35\%. These findings underscore the importance of considering design features in BWAS and emphasize that increasing sample size is not the only approach to improve the replicability of BWAS.},

An algorithmic pipeline for single-cell antigen quantification in tightly packed tissues was developed and used to overlay well-known morphological features with de novo characterization of lymphoid tissue architecture at a single-cell and cellular neighborhood levels. We observed an unexpected, profound impact of the cellular neighborhood on the expression of protein receptors on immune cells. By comparing normal murine spleen to spleens from animals with systemic autoimmune disease (MRL/lpr), extensive and previously uncharacterized splenic cell-interaction dynamics in the healthy versus diseased state was observed.

Here, we review the technological progress of spatial omics and how advanced computation methods boost multi-modal spatial data analysis.

So far, spatial omics is placing us in the golden age of spatial cancer research.

Single-cell analyses, especially RNA sequencing and other genomics modalities, have been transformative in revealing novel biomarkers and molecular regulators associated with tumor growth, metastasis and drug resistance. However, these approaches fail to provide a complete picture of tumor biology, as information on cellular location within the tumor microenvironment is lost. New technologies leveraging multiplexed fluorescence, DNA, RNA and isotope labeling enable the detection of tens to thousands of cancer subclones or molecular biomarkers within their native spatial context. The expeditious growth in these techniques, along with methods for multiomics data integration, promises to yield a more comprehensive understanding of cell-to-cell variation within and between individual tumors.

	abstract = {The architecture of normal and diseased tissues strongly influences the development and progression of disease as well as responsiveness and resistance to therapy. We describe a tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) method for highly multiplexed immuno-fluorescence imaging of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens mounted on glass slides, the most widely used specimens for histopathological diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. t-CyCIF generates up to 60-plex images using an iterative process (a cycle) in which conventional low-plex fluorescence images are repeatedly collected from the same sample and then assembled into a high-dimensional representation. t-CyCIF requires no specialized instruments or reagents and is compatible with super-resolution imaging; we demonstrate its application to quantifying signal transduction cascades, tumor antigens and immune markers in diverse tissues and tumors. The simplicity and adaptability of t-CyCIF makes it an effective method for pre-clinical and clinical research and a natural complement to single-cell genomics., To diagnose a disease such as cancer, doctors sometimes take small tissue samples called biopsies from the affected area. These biopsies are then thinly sliced and treated with dyes to identify healthy and cancerous cells. However, clinicians and scientists often need to look into what happens inside individual cells in the tissues so they can understand how cancers arise and progress. This helps them to identify different types of tumor cells and to tailor the best treatment for the patient., To do so, a number of proteins (the molecules involved in nearly all life’s processes) need to be tracked in healthy and diseased cells and tissues. This can be done thanks to a range of methods known as immunofluorescence microscopy, but following different proteins on the same slice of a sample is difficult. However, a new type of immunofluorescence known as t-CyCIF may be a solution., With this technique, a fluorescent compound is applied that will bind to a specific protein of interest. A microscope can pick up the light from the compound when the sample is imaged, which reveals the protein’s location in the cell or tissue. Then, a substance is used that deactivates the fluorescence signal. After this, another compound that binds to a new type of protein is used, and imaged. This cycle is repeated several times to locate different proteins. Lastly, the individual images are processed and stitched together to reveal the cells and their internal structures., Here, Lin, Izar et al. showed that t-CyCIF could be used to study biopsies and to obtain images that covered a large area of healthy human tissues and tumors. The technique helped to track over 60 different proteins in normal and tumor tissue samples from human patients. Several sets of experiments showed that t-CyCIF could uncover the molecular mechanisms that are disrupted during cancer, but also reveal the complexity of a single tumor. In fact, as shown with biopsies of brain cancer, cancerous cells in a tumor can be strikingly different, even when they are close to each other. Finally, the method helped to pinpoint which types of immune cells are involved in fighting a kidney tumor. Overall, such information cannot be obtained with conventional methods, yet is crucial for diagnosis and treatment., Most laboratories can readily use t-CyCIF since the technique is open source and requires equipment that is easily accessible. In fact, the technique should soon be used to assess how well certain drugs help the immune system combat cancer. Ultimately, better use of biopsies is key to customizing cancer care.},

Here, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplexed tissue-imaging to characterize the composition, spatial organization, and clinical significance of extracellular purinergic signaling in glioma. We show that microglia are the predominant source of CD39, while tumor cells principally express CD73. In glioblastoma, CD73 is associated with EGFR amplification, astrocyte-like differentiation, and increased adenosine, and is linked to hypoxia. Glioblastomas enriched for CD73 exhibit inflammatory microenvironments, suggesting that purinergic signaling regulates immune adaptation. Spatially-resolved single-cell analyses demonstrate a strong spatial correlation between tumor-CD73 and microglial-CD39, with proximity associated with poor outcomes. Similar spatial organization is present in pediatric high-grade gliomas including H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma. These data reveal that purinergic signaling in gliomas is shaped by genotype, lineage, and functional state, and that core enzymes expressed by tumor and myeloid cells are organized to promote adenosine-rich microenvironments potentially amenable to therapeutic targeting.},

Like other high-throughput assays, these approaches can suffer from unwanted noise and technical artifacts that obscure the biological signal. In this work, we consider how an experimental design incorporating multiple levels of replication enables the removal of technical artifacts from such image-based platforms.
RESULTS: We develop a general approach to remove technical artifacts from high-throughput image data that leverages an experimental design with multiple levels of replication. To illustrate the methods, we consider microenvironment microarrays (MEMAs), a high-throughput platform designed to study cellular responses to microenvironmental perturbations. In application to MEMAs, our approach removes unwanted spatial artifacts and thereby enhances the biological signal. This approach has broad applicability to diverse biological assays.

Charting these states along progression pseudotime, we observed a transition to immune exclusion in CIN+ tumors as characterized by a novel gene expression signature comprised of DDR1, TGFBI, PAK4, and DPEP1. We demonstrated how these genes and their protein products are key regulators of extracellular matrix components, are associated with lower cytotoxic immune infiltration, and show prognostic value in external cohorts. Through high-dimensional data integration, this atlas provides insights into co-evolution of tumors and their microenvironments, serving as a resource for stratification and targeted treatment of CRC.},

In addition to antibodies against traditional checkpoint molecules or their ligands (i.e., CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1), therapies targeting molecules such as ICOS, IDO-1, LAG-3, OX40, TIM-3, and VISTA are currently in clinical trials. To better inform clinical care and the design of therapeutic combination strategies, the co-expression of immunoregulatory proteins on individual immune cells within the tumor microenvironment must be robustly characterized. Highly multiplexed tissue imaging platforms, such as CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX), are primed to meet this need by enabling {\textgreater}50 markers to be simultaneously analyzed in single-cells on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. Assembly and validation of antibody panels is particularly challenging, with respect to the specificity of antigen detection and robustness of signal over background. Herein, we report the design, development, optimization, and application of a 56-marker CODEX antibody panel to eight cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) patient samples. This panel is comprised of structural, tumor, and immune cell markers, including eight immunoregulatory proteins that are approved or currently undergoing clinical trials as immunotherapy targets. Here we provide a resource to enable extensive high-dimensional, spatially resolved characterization of the tissue microenvironment across tumor types and imaging modalities. This framework provides researchers with a readily applicable blueprint to study tumor immunology, tissue architecture, and enable mechanistic insights into immunotherapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {Psychomotor disturbance has been identified as a key feature of psychotic disorders, with motor signs observed in upwards of 66\% of unmedicated, first-episode patients. Aberrations in the cerebellum have been directly linked to sensorimotor processing deficits including processing speed, which may underly psychomotor disturbance in psychosis, though these brain-behavior-symptom relationships are unclear, in part due to within-diagnosis heterogeneity across these levels of analysis. In 339 psychosis patients (242 schizophrenia-spectrum, 97 bipolar with psychotic features) and 217 controls, we evaluated the relationship between cerebellar grey matter volume in the Yeo sensorimotor network and psychomotor disturbance (mannerisms and posturing, retardation, excitement of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS]), as mediated by processing speed (assessed via the SCIP). Models included intracranial volume, age, sex, and chlorpromazine equivalents as covariates. We observed significant mediation by processing speed, with a small positive effect of the cerebellum on processing speed (ß = 0.172, p = 0.029, d = 0.24) and a medium negative effect of processing speed on psychomotor disturbance (ß = −0.254, p {\textless} 0.001, d = 0.60), with acceptable specificity and sensitivity suggesting this model is robust against unmeasured confounding. The current findings suggest a critical role of cerebellar circuitry in a well-established sensorimotor aberration in psychosis (processing speed) and the presentation of related psychomotor phenotypes within psychosis. Establishing such relationships is critical for intervention research, such as TMS. Future work will employ more dimensional measures of psychomotor disturbance and cognitive processes to capture normative and aberrant brain-behavior-symptom relationships and may also determine the magnitude of these relationships within subtypes of psychosis (e.g., disorganized behavior, catatonia).},

	abstract = {Background
Catatonia, a form of acute brain dysfunction typically linked with severe affective and psychotic disorders, occurs in critical illness with delirium and coma. Delirium and coma are associated with mortality, though catatonia's relationship with mortality is unclear. We aim to describe whether catatonia, delirium, and coma are associated with mortality.
Methods
We enrolled a convenience cohort of critically ill adults (N = 378) at an academic medical center. We assessed catatonia, delirium, and coma using the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale, the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, respectively. We tested the associations between previous day brain dysfunction state occurrence with in-hospital and one-year mortality using multivariable time-dependent risk models. Additionally, we tested the association between brain dysfunction duration and one-year mortality.
Results
Catatonia was not associated with death on the day after diagnosis during hospitalization, and neither previous catatonia occurrence nor duration was associated with one-year mortality. Delirium was not associated with death on any day following diagnosis during hospitalization, and neither previous delirium occurrence nor duration was associated with one-year mortality. The occurrence of coma was associated with death on any day after diagnosis during hospitalization (HR 2.30,CI 1.19–4.44,p = 0.014), as well as through one year following hospital discharge (HR 1.68,CI 1.09–2.59,p = 0.02).
Conclusions
Coma, but neither catatonia nor delirium, was associated with future day in-hospital and one-year mortality. More research is needed to understand catatonia's clinical impact. Delirium results differ from existing literature likely due to cohort demographics and size. Coma results highlight the prognostic significance of suppressed arousal while critically ill.},

There is limited research as to whether such patterns are consonant in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a condition marked by social challenges, dysregulation of the HPA axis, and higher rates of depression setting the stage for enhanced vulnerability during this developmental period.The current study interrogated diurnal cortisol by examining (1) cortisol expression longitudinally over the pubertal transition between autistic and neurotypical youth, (2) the trajectory of diurnal cortisol and the unique contributions of age vs. puberty, and (3) potential sex differences. As hypothesized, results indicate autistic compared to typically developing youth demonstrate a shallower diurnal slope and elevated evening cortisol. These differences were in the context of higher cortisol and flatter rhythms based on age and pubertal development. Also, sex-based differences emerged such that females in both groups had higher cortisol, flatter slopes, and higher evening cortisol than males. The results show that despite the trait-like stability of diurnal cortisol, HPA maturation is impacted by age, puberty, sex, as well as an ASD diagnosis.},

	abstract = {IntroductionPediatric catatonia is a highly co-morbid condition with treatment options often limited to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or lorazepam. However, lorazepam may not be readily available, and access to ECT is limited by restrictive legislation and stigma. This study aims to provide alternative treatment options for pediatric catatonia.MethodsThe study involved a single-site retrospective analysis of a private university hospital in the southern United States. The study included patients under eighteen with catatonia who received psychopharmacologic treatment with an agent other than lorazepam. The patients were evaluated with the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), Kanner Catatonia Severity Scale (KCS), and Kanner Catatonia Examination (KCE) at the time of initial evaluation and upon stabilization. A retrospective clinical global impressions-improvement (CGI-I) score was assigned by four authors.Results102 pediatric patients diagnosed with catatonia were identified, and 31 met criteria for the study. 20 (65\%) were white, 6 (19\%) were Black, 4 (13\%) were Hispanic, and 1 (3\%) were Indian. Most patients (N = 18; 58\%) were insured by Medicaid. The mean age at the time of catatonia diagnosis was 13.5 years. All patients were stabilized on either clonazepam or diazepam, with 21 (68\%) requiring treatment with an additional medication of either an anti-epileptic, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, and aripiprazole or clozapine. Statistically significant reductions in the BFCRS [t = 11.2, df = 30, std = 6.3, p {\textless} 0.001, 95\% CI = (7.8, 15.1)], KCS [t = 4.6, df = 38, p {\textless} 0.001, 95\% CI = (12.0, 31.0)], and KCE [t = 7.8, df = 30, std = 1.8, p {\textless} 0.001, 95\% CI = (1.9, 3.2)] were observed. For CGI-I the results showed that the estimated probability of observing a score better than no change ({\textgreater}4) is 0.976 [t.s. = 43.2, p {\textless} 0.001, 95\% CI = (0.931,0.992)], indicating the average subject is expected to experience some improvement.DiscussionIn conclusion, all patients responded to these treatments with improvement in their catatonic symptoms. Alternative pharmacologic interventions for catatonia, including benzodiazepines other than lorazepam, valproic acid, NMDA receptor antagonists, and atypical antipsychotics were safe and effective in treating catatonia in this population.},
